Dear All:

  

We found this fragment of a Book.

  

Title/Author/Publisher info all missing

  

It appears to be a Shaiva Bhashya on Brahma Sutras.

2 Scholars who were also not aware of this Text said it appeared to be an English Translation of Shri Kanth Bhashya.

  

Can anyone identify the Author/Publisher/Title.

  

I would love to order the Full Book.

  

Thanks and regards.
