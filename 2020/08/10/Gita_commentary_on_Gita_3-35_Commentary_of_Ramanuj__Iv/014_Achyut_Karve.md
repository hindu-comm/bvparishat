Dear Vidwans,

  

What is meant by the word dharma? Is it a disposition or an act? What are its characteristics? Is it necessarily material? How does the import of the word dharma change in a society given to division of labour? How has dharma have anything to do with yoga?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
