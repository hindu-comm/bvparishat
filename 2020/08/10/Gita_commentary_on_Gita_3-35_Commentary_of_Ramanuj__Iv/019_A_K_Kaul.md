Shri V Subrahmanianji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Are the individuals 'Bhaskara' and 'Bhatta Bhaskara' the same?>

Yes, they are one and the same, as will be clear from the attachment "Bhaskara=Bhatta-Bhaskara"---a page from the Gudartha-Sangra commentary on the Gita 18/2 by Acharya Abhinavgupta.

The commentary on the Taittiriya Brahmana etc. by Bhatta Bhaskara is by "Bhatta Bhaskara Mishra".

With regards and Jai ShriRam!

A K Kaul
