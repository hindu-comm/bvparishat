Many thanks for the above details. Yes, I had read the Bhaskara's bhashya on the Pancharatra adhikaraNam of the Brahma sutra and had found it to be almost the same as that of Shankaracharya for that adhikaranam. Is there any study/listing of the quotations Bhaskara used in his Brahma sutra bhashya? I would like to see that as it would save the time and effort of reading his entire bhashya. This is because there is no searchable document of his bhashya and it would be of help to many if someone does make one. 

  

Thanks, Sri Kaul ji, for the clarification.

  

warm regards
