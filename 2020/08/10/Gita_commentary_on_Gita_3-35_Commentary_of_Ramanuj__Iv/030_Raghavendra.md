'Sameness / Similarity, or agreement' among connoisseurs of thought, if appreciated, will not lead to a feeling of anger and/or bitterness. Agreed.

  

Failing to appreciate the above spirit led Narendra Puri rancour the way he did on a solemn occasion of writing commentary on a Upanishad (going by the observation below)

  

"In an interesting fragment of his Chhandogya Upanishad Bhashya (cited by Narendra Puri), he had accused Shankaracharya of wholesale copying the commentary of Dravidacharya. To which Narendra Puri argued that Bhashya had himself stolen passage after passage from Shankaracharya's commentary".

  

Is that what we are saying? NO.

  

That was 'not germane' to the discussion. Imitation, or more precisely, emulating is 'not wrong'. Calling it as 'wholesale copying' and/or
'stealing' is 'wrong' was my firm view.

  

From Shankara to Ramanuja to Srikantha to Madhva, the conducted tour continuing right upto to our own times did not serve any purpose.

  

Why should anyone rancour seeing the ambition of others at excelling.

  
Best regards,
