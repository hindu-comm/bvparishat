Dear Krishna Kashyap Ji,

  

  As you are interested in the multiple interpretations of the Bhagavad-Gītā by commentators, you may wish to look up a book titled Gītā-Bhāṣya-Prakāśa by the Late Professor T. G. Mainkar. It is a short book comparing interpretations from the prominent Bhāṣyas on some select verses of the BG. Here is the link to download the pdf for this book:

  Professor Mainkar was my teacher at the Fergusson College and among the various courses he taught was a course on the BG. With bestregards,
