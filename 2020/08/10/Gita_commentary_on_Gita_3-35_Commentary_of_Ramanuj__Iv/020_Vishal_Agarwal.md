The Bhaskara whom I referred to is Bhaskara Bhatta, the Bhedabheda Vedanta teacher whose fragmentary Gita Bhashya, complete Brahmasutra Bhashya survive, and whose Chhandogya Upanishad Bhashya is lost (except for fragments quoted in Narendra Puri's Tippana, that are reproduced by Anandagiri). Some scholars suggest that this teacher was from Kashmir, others suggest he was a Karnataka origin scholar. I think he was from somewhere in Western India and a follower of Madhyandiya Shakha (just my guess, on the basis of his tendency to quote Katyayana Sutras, Shatapatha etc). He lived sometime between Shankaracharya and Vachaspati Mishra. In an interesting fragment of his Chhandogya Upanishad Bhashya (cited by Narendra Puri), he had accused Shankaracharya of wholesale copying the commentary of Dravidacharya. To which Narendra Puri argued that Bhashya had himself stolen passage after passage from Shankaracharya's commentary. Actually, we see the same often close correspondence between the Brahmasutra Bhashyas of Shankaracharya and Bhaskara.

  

The Bhatta Bhaskara you refer to is of course the famous commentator of Taittiriya Shakha and he is a different person. I am not sure where he was from but I have read that he was from the Andhra Pradesh region based on certain usages and examples that he gives in his Jnanayajna Bhashya.
