Imitation is not wrong.

  

It appears, Narendra Puri squared up the accusation. You accuse me, I accuse you, type.

  

Bhaskara imitates Shankara is a known fact. Sentences after sentences are mirrored in the bhashya of Bhaskara and it is there to see, Bhaskara accusing Shankara of stealing is wrong and it is plain and simple,

  

Accusing Bhaskara of stealing is also wrong and it is a strong word to use.

  

If Bhaskara has stolen texts of Shankara, in the same vein, Shankara can also be accused of the same crime.

  

Just see,

  

शाबर-भाष्य

अयमथ शब्दो … प्रागपि च वेदाध्यनात् … अथ शब्दो … हेत्वर्थः … धर्मः प्रसिद्धो वा स्यात् अप्रसिद्धो वा … स चेत् प्रसिद्धो, न जिज्ञासितव्यः … विप्रतिपन्ना बहुविधः … निःश्रेयसेन … प्रतिजानीमहे ...

  

शाङ्कर-भाष्य

अयमथ शब्दः … प्रागपि च धर्मजिज्ञासायाः … अथ शब्दो हेत्वर्थः … ब्रह्म प्रसिद्धम् अप्रसिद्धं वा स्यात् … यदि प्रसिद्धं न जिज्ञासितव्यं … बहवो विप्रतिपन्ना … निःश्रेयसात् प्रतिहन्येत ...

  

As it can be seen, some phrases are mirrored as it is, others suitably modified,

  

I cannot, even in my wild imagination, accuse Shankara of stealing texts from Shabara. There is imitation and that’s it and the full stop should end there.

  

There are mantras which are interspersed within the texts of the Brahmana, Aranyaka Upanishad texts. There are texts of the Upanishad interspersed within the texts of the Gita. Can the authors of the latter texts be accused of the same crime? No not at all. Period (.)

  

In our eagerness to glorify infallibility and greatness of ancient thinkers, we cannot be prejudiced with the ones that have come later and who have imitated. Bhaskara came later and imitated and hence he is fallible, Shankara came earlier to him and hence infallible is stretching wild imagination too far and nothing else.

  

Narendra Puri should have known the same argument will hold good in the case of Shankara also, as Shankara came later to Shabara and imitated and hence Shankara is fallible and Shabara came earlier and hence he is infallible.

  

In conclusion, I would like to say this, the we are the heir apparent of the glorious tradition that has come down to us, we are a fortunate lot, let’s respect it, all said and done, the things that have to happen have happened 1000 to 1200 years ago, Neither Bhaskara becomes criminal just because Narendra Puri accuses him of stealing passages after passages from the writings of Shankara nor Shankara (be accused of the same criminality) just because Bhaskara alleged Shankara stealing from Dravidacharya.

Many thanks for the above details. Yes, I had read the Bhaskara's bhashya on the Pancharatra adhikaraNam of the Brahma sutra and had found it to be almost the same as that of Shankaracharya for that adhikaranam. Is there any study/listing of the quotations Bhaskara used in his Brahma sutra bhashya? I would like to see that as it would save the time and effort of reading his entire bhashya. This is because there is no searchable document of his bhashya and it would be of help to many if someone does make one. 

  

Thanks, Sri Kaul ji, for the clarification.

  

warm regards
