Other than the 10 major Upanishads, Bhagvatapada quotes Kaushitaki, Mahanarayana, Shvetashvatara, Jabala (9 times of which 5 are traceable), Kathashruti (in Brhad Up Bhashya), Kaivalya (by name, in his intro to Aitareya Upanishad Bhashya), Nr Ut Tapaniya (only citation is 'Brahmaivedam Sarvam'), Paippalada Brahmasukta (Samhita Upanishad), Shatyayani Shruti (identified by Ramanuja who cites identical words) - similar quotation is found in Jaiminiya Brahmana book I, a brief discussion between Badhva and Bashkalin (non traceable), a passage 'akashvat sarvagatashcha nityashcha' (non traceable, a slightly variant 'akashvat sarvagatascha sukshmascha is found in Shandilya Upanishad where it appears to be a quotation too), Paingi Rahasya Brahmana (we find more details about this in Shrutaprakashika of Sudarshanasuri while he critiques Bhagvatpada) interpretation of 'dvaa suparnaaa...'). IMHO, the surviving 'vritti' on Baskhala Mantra Upanishad might also be his commentary.

  

Amongst Brahmanas, he cites Aitareya, Tandya, Shatpatha (both recensions), Taittiriya, Kaushitaki, Shadvimsha, Paingi (one quotation), Shatyayani, Bhallavi (one quotation on Karmakanda, Sureshvara in his Sambandha Varttika gives a different Adhyatmic citation from this Shakha). He refers to Jaiminiya Upanishad Brahmana (or rather, the Shatyayana Aranyaka); presumes an Upanishad Mantra Amnaya of Atharvaveda; a Samachara grantha of Atharvanikas (presumably their lost Dharmasutra). He also cites Kathaka Samhita and Maitrayani Samhita (once each), and the Brahmasukta mantra from Atharvaveda Paippalada Samhita.

  

Earlier Vedantic teachers pre-supposed by him (according to his subcommentators) are Brahmadatta, Bhartriprapancha, Dravidacharya, Brahmanandi, Vrttikara, Sundara Pandya in addition to Gaudapada of course.

  

Amongst Smritis, he quotes Gita, Manu, Gautama, Vashishtha, Apastamba, Baudhayana. He refers to Devala Dharmasutra. A possible citation from Daksha Smriti.

  

Among Puranas, verses quoted by him are traceable to Vishnu, Vayu, Linga, Shiva per printed editions.

  

An unknown Yogashastra is quoted by him in commentaries on Sutras as well as Gita in addition to Yogasutras.

  

According to Ratnaprabha, he has referred to the views of Ravanabhashya on Vaisheshikasutras while criticizing that Darshana in Brahmasutra Bhashya.

  

For Samkhya, he quotes the Karika. Pandit Udayavira Shashtra also refers to a Samkhyasutra citation. The Purvapaksha of Samkhyas in his Shariraka Bhashya is often, in my opinion, the Siddhanta Paksha stated in the Yuktidipika.

  

Other works quoted by him include Bhashikasutra, Nirukta, Ashtadhyayi, Ramayana, Mahabharata etc.
