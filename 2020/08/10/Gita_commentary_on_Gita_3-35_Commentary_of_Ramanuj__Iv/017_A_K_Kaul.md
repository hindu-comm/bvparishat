Shri Vishal Agarwalji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thankyou for the mail as well as the attachment.  

In your earlier mail/attachment about the Gita-3/35, you have talked about Bhatta Bhaskara's commentary on the Gita.

I hve not been able to get it from any source in pdf and I learn that the hard copy that is available with some publisher has a commentary of nine chapters only

<https://groups.google.com/g/bvparishat/c/mCnJIX03UJo>

I would be grateful if you could provide some details about the pdf source. If it is available only as a hard copy, kindly let me know the pblisher etc. so that I could get it from Amazon or Flipkart etc.

It will take me some time to pore on the points discussed by you, and if you so desire, we can compare notes, either on this august forum or in privae, whatever way you want, though again, I would prefer the latter, since, honsestly, I find the members of this august forum quite receptive to even the contrarian views, unlike several other (Yahoo) forums which banned me because I did not toe their line!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
