Shri Vishal Agarwalji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your notes, which are in conformity with the general view/interpretation of the Gita 3.35, especially when one ponders on 8/6-7

यं यं वापिस्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेवरम् \| तं तमेवैति कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः \|\|

तस्मात् सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युद्य च\| मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्य्स्यसंशयः \|\|  

You may kindly send me your notes on 18/47-48 (at jyotirved at the rate of [gmail.com](http://gmail.com)) if you do not want to share them with the forum, though I would prefer the latter.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
