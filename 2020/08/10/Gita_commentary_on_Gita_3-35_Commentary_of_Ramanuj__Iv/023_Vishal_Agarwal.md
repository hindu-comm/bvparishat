Please see attached. Note that at the end is also a Diplomatic edition of all four chapters with quotations' sources pointed out.

  

The Gita Bhashya has its own interesting set of quotations. I think it has the earliest quotation from Yajnavalkya Smriti (with the source clearly listed as such) that I know of. In both the works are also interesting verses from the Yogashastra of Sanaka (now lost).
