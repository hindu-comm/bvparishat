Shri Vishal Agarwalji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks indeed for Bhatta-Bhaskara's Gita, for which I had been trying for several years!

My interest was heightened by T K Gopalaswamy Iyengar's paper "Bhaskara on the Gita" which I had downloaded together with the commentary by Bhaskara (most probably) from "Satisar Foundation" several years back.

Somehow the commentary got "corrupt" and was not available anywhere again!

The paper by Iyengar is attached!

Many thanks once again.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
