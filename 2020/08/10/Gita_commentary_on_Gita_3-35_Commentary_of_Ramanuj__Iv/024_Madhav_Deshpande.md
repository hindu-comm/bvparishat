Dear Vishal,

  

  Thanks for a stimulating discussion, information and references. I wonder if there is a study like "literature quoted/presupposed by Śaṅkarācārya"? What I have in mind are sections where he critiques Buddhism and other traditions. He rarely quotes actual Buddhist passages/texts, and it is left to us to figure out if he is referring to some generic information about these traditions or if he has some specific authors/texts in mind. With best wishes,
