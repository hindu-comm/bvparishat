Sri Krishna Kashyap-ji,

  

To that extent , Dr Sastry has already noted.

  

He is expressing his surprise about such a formulation.

  

I am trying to guess my reasons for his surprise :

  

People have been taking varnaashramabased vihita karma for each individualas svadharma and what is vihita for the other varna and ashrama than that of the individual as paradharma for that individual.

  

But this formulation is not on those lines. Why ?

  

-- seems to be the reason for the surprise.
