Several years ago the renownedscholarSri Mani Dravid SastrinaH had delivered a talk in an assembly where he touched upon several instances where Shankara had closely followed the Purva Mimamsa. In fact in his doctoral thesis too he has worked on this closeness between the Purva and Uttara Mimamsa.

  

That said, over the years we tend to come to conclude that an Acharya could have followed his predecessor and that not everything that he has said is completely 'original'. This is because such a phenomenon can't be wished away. No two doctrines are totally different from each other; there is certainly overlap, how much or how less is what determines finally how 'new' a system is from an earlier existing one. I recall an instance of the most recent times: There is the famous verse that summarizes the Madhva system 'श्रीमन्मध्वमते हरिः परतरः सत्यं जगत्....' (attributed to Sri Vyasa Tirtha). A few years ago renowned Madhva scholar Sri Bannanje Govindacharya, finding this verse not adequately exclusively representing the Madhva system as many of the tenets specified therinoverlap with Ramanuja's doctrine, composed a new shloka to more clearly and uniquely depict the Madhva school.

  

Late Polagam Rama Sastry has listed some 50 points of overlap across the four schools: Advaita, SrikanTha's Shiva Advaita, V.Advaita, and Dvaita.

  

Shankara in his invocation to the Taittiriya Bhashya pays homage to 'all those Acharyas who have 'commented' on 'all' the Upanishads':

  

यैरिमेगुरुभिःपूर्वंपदवाक्यप्रमाणतः।

व्याख्याताःसर्ववेदान्तास्तान्नित्यंप्रणतोऽस्म्यहम्॥ २ ॥ 

  

He has also explicitly stated in the Brahma Sutra Bhashyam: परमतमप्रतिषिद्धमनुमतं भवति and explicitly commended Sankhya, Nyaya and even Bauddha for a certain tenet that is non-contradictory to Vedanta.
So, when he has critiqued any school such as the Bhedaabheda, of which many shades appear to be there, it is quite possible he has accepted certain tenets of those schools that are not in conflict with his form of Advaita. We do get indications in the Upanishad bhashyatoo for certain views prevailing at his time over a particular mantra. So too we can speculate that his Gita Bhashya could have accommodated already existing interpretations of the verses there. In the introduction itself he says that many commentaries have been there for the Gita. The Bhaskara Gita Bhashya too is not free of instances of 'sameness/similarity' with the Shaankara Gita Bhashya. 

  

One can also notice total agreement between Shankara and Ramanuja on certain sutra-s.

  

The more this feature is appreciated, the less will be occasions for rancour.
