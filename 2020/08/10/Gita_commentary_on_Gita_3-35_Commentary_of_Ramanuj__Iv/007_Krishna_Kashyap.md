**See attached Sloka 35.pdf**. **files** I was able to edit it properly. However, the word program had some problems with my Sanskrit fonts.

hence I have made it into a pdf.

  

Please note:

  

my teacher Dr. N.S.Anantharangachar used to say: **"Lord Krishna is impartial. he has given equal amount of difficulty to all commentators of Bhagavadgita!**". Hence, Gita is a difficultscripture and all commentators have some difficulty regarding certain verses.

  

This is obvious when you read Gita bhashya from different commentators **in-depth(I stress this word in-depth!).**

  

One should view these commentaries keeping in mind that:

  

the focus of Sri Shankaracharya is goal-focused or (sAdhya focussed), Whereasfor both Sri Ramanujacharya and Sri Madhvacharya it is "sAdhana focused"

or

in a different way, Sri Shankaracharya's approach is like "suka mArga" or path of a bird which flies on a straight path to fruit of a tree, the goal and the other 2 acharyas have taken the "pipIlikA marga" or the path of an ant which goes on a step by step route towards the fruit on a tree.

  

Note in this analogy: not everyone can fly like a bird. This is for advanced aspirants only.

This does not mean that Sri Shankaracharya ignores sadhana aspects. it just means the priority or focus is different.
