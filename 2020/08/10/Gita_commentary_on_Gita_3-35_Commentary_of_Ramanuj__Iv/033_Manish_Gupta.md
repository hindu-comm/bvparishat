Dear Sirs,

  

Please read Shloka 4/8. Which secret tatvagyan (yogvidya) Shri Krishna ji is talking about in this shloka because of which his Karma and birth was divine (aprakritik)? Which vidya he is referring to after knowing that we do not haveto take birth again and have command over your birth ?  

  

  

Kind regards,

MAnish
