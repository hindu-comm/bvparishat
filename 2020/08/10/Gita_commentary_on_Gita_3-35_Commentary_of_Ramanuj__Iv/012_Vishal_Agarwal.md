Namaskar!

  

I have been somewhat away from the BVP and just started reading this thread. There was considerable discussion on Gita 3.35 on my Facebook wall (visible only to my FB friends) coincidentally about 2 weeks ago.



I am attaching some notes on this verse from my own self-study exercise (work in progress) on verses 3.34-3.35. Especially, the 'Notes' from page 4 onwards of the attached file will be helpful.

  

  

When Shri Ramanuja and Shri Vedanta Deshika comment on 3.35 and 18.47, their use of 'Svadharma' stands for 'Svadharma of Arjuna' and not for everyone else. And accordingly, in their commentaries, Svadharma = participation int he war; 'Paradharma' = taking Sannyasa by Arjuna. In other words, their commentary on 3.35 and 18.47 presumes a context specific to Arjuna; and they do not take this verse as a general injunction applicable to all in this exact wording. I'd be glad to share my notes on 18.47-48 etc with those who are interested.

  

Note also that verse 3.35 has an interesting textual variant in Kashmirian mauscripts.

  

  

With regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
