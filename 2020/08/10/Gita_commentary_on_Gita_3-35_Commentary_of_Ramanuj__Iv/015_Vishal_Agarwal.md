Please see attached. I wasn't sure if everyone will be interested which is why I offered to send them privately earlier.

  

While teaching the Gita, I try to incorporate at least one illustration or story from the Hindu tradition to explain the meaning better. Hence, you will find a story each under the two verses.

  

With regards,

  

Vishal Agarwal
