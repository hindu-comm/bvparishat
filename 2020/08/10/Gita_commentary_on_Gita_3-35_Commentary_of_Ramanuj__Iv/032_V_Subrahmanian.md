Namaste

  

It is well known that across the prasthana traya bhashya of Shankara Bhagavatpada, a very significant and conspicuous expression isनित्यशुद्धबुद्धमुक्तस्वभावः which occurs dozens of times both in the context of Brahman and jiva's svarupa. We find this expression in the Nrsimha Tapinyupanishat:<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_upanishhat/nrisinha.html>

  

Here, the context is: That Brahman, having created the pancha bhutas, the sense organs, Viraat, the devataa-s, the kosha-s, entered into that which has been created and though never deluded, engages in all activity as though deluded due to maayaa. Therefore, the Upanishad says, the true nature of Brahman is 'advaya, without a second, Pure Existence, Eternal, Pure (blemishless), Consciousness, the Real, ever liberated, untainted, all pervading, secondless bliss, supreme, the innermost Self, known though these pramana-s, pure existence alone is what all this is. 

  

What is significant is:

  

1\. The above stated expression that is very widely found in the Shankara's bhashyam, नित्यशुद्धबुद्धमुक्तस्वभावः is found in the Upanishad.

  

2\. In the manner that Shankara has used this to refer to the jiva as well as Brahman, we see this Upanishad endorsing the stand of Shankara in the cited part: Brahman alone is appearing as the jiva.

``` स वा एष भूतानीन्द्रियाणि विराजं देवताः कोशांश्च सृष्ट्वा प्रविश्यामूढो मूढ इव व्यवहरन्नास्ते माययैव तस्मादद्वय एवायमात्मा सन्मात्रो नित्यः शुद्धो बुद्धः सत्यो मुक्तो निरञ्जनो विभुरद्वयानन्दः परः प्रत्यगेकरसः प्रमाणैरेतैरवगतः सत्तामात्रं हीदं सर्वं सदेव पुरस्तात्सिद्धं हि ब्रह्म ```

``` [Incidentally, Sayanacharya, in his commentary to the Purusha Suktam, at the passage 'सर्वाणि रूपाणि विचित्य धीरः नामानि कृत्वा अभिवदन् यदास्ते..' cites the above mantra.] 
```

```
 
```

``` 3. The Upanishad uses this set of epithets to both Brahman and the jiva: ```

```
   होचुः स होवाच तद्वा एतद्ब्रह्माद्वयं ब्रह्मत्वान्नित्यं शुद्धं बुद्धं मुक्तं सत्यं सूक्ष्मं परिपूर्णमद्वयं सदानन्दचिन्मात्रमात्मैवाव्यवहार्यं केन च तत्तदेतदात्मानमोमित्यपश्यन्तः पश्यत तदेतत्सत्यमात्मा ब्रह्मैव ब्रह्मात्मैवात्र ह्येव न विचिकित्स्यमित्यों सत्यं तदेतत्पण्डिता एव पश्यन्ति. ```

``` ```
