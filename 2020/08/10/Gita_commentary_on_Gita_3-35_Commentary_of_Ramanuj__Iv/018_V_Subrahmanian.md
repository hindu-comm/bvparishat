Namaste

  

Are the individuals 'Bhaskara' and 'Bhatta Bhaskara' the same? I think the Gita Bhashya of a 'Bhaskara' discussed in the BVP thread you show below is by Bhaskara who flourished just after Shankaracharya and who refuted hisBrahma sutra Bhashya. But Bhatta Bhaskara is a different individual whose commentary on the Veda along with Sayanacharya is also available. This is my understanding. Those who have more information about the identity of the two individuals may kindly provide the same.

  

Thanks and regards
