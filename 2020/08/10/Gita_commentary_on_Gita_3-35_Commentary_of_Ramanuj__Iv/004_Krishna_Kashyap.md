namaste Sri BVK Sastry avare.

  

I will send two emails regarding this.

  

1\) general principle of Sri Ramanujabhashyaregarding svadharma and paradharma.

due to association of karma, our minds cannot naturally focus on atma. our minds are pulled constantly towards "indriyArthas" or sense objects. Hence what is natural to us is karma yoga.

jnana yoga in general is paradharma, since it is unnatural for people bound in samsara.

states that if one cannot focus on Atma while meditating, one can end up being a mithyachari, since his rajas tamo gunas are pulling him/her towards objectsof senses. He acts as if in meditation, but only thinks of sense objects!

  

Hence in general jnana yoga is difficult, unnatural, and para dharma to most people! it applies more to rare aspirants similar to "suka maharshi" or someone similar to sukamaharshi.

Hence, jnana yoga is taken as paradharma to most people. it is also pramAda garbha, ie. filled with dangers. if one does jnana yoga without karma yoga, he can lose both, since his powerful senses can disturb him and make him think of sense objects and since he has already given up karma yoga, as he thinks he is an adhikari for jnana yoga, he loses both sadhana margas!!

Here it is clear that karma is better than jnana, which is akarma. for Sri Ramanujacharya, akarma means NOT karma, which is jnAna.

karmayoga is superior to jnana yoga, as per this shloka. for sharira yatra karma is necessary, anyway. hence, you cannot give up karma yoga.

Here, karmayoga is sufficient means is explained.

even for a jnani who is a public figure, he has to do karmayogato make sure he is an example to others, who should not wrongly jump by following him into jnana yoga being not adhikaris of jnana yoga.

  

due to various such reasons, karmayoga is taken as svadharma and jnanayogais taken as paradharma.

the varnashrama dharma based meaning is quite restrictive. Sri Ramanujacharya gives a more generally applicable meaning to svadharma, paradharma terms.

  

note in the verse:

  

when Arjuna asks that "why is it that human beings are pushed to do papas even if they dont want to do them"

Sri Krishna answers:

indicating "kama" is very hard to win.

hence svadharma is taken as "svashakya", what is doable by us.

paradharma is taken as "para shakya", what is doable by others.

details are in Tatparya chandrika.

  

it is NOT A DEFENSIVE RECONCILIATION. as mentioned in this statement by Sri BVK SastryJi.

"Commentary of Sri Vednata deshika appeared to me a defensive reconciliation."

  

due to brevity, I have not included details. This argument that svadharma and paradharma is developed in Sri Ramanuja bhashya and Tatparya Chandrika of sri Vedanta Desika in great detail in so many verses of Gita that it is very hard to summarize here, without writing a PhD thesis!

  

see tatparya chandrika here carefully.
