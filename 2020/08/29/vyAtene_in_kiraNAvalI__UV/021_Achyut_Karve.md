Dear Deshpandeji,

  

"It brings up the fact that all commentators are trying their best to reconcile the intention of Pāṇini as they understand with the facts of usage as they know."

  

The above statement means that there was an attempt at reconciliation between the sutras of the Asthadhyayiand the general usage prevalent at that particular time or period. The question that needs to be asked is whether these differences were only in the form of the words or much deeper, that is were these differences or alternate word forms on account of change common usage or because of a change in the way both in terms of effort and place of phonation of the shisthas.

  

One finds roots added to the dhatupatha after Panini. Let us take an example from the dhatupatha श्लाघृ and श्लाख्रु. In the aforesaid two dhatus are both the लकार's the same. Are both dental? or one of the two one is dental and the other one an alveolar, or one is dental and the other is retroflex? Take another example of the root दद. Are both the द's phonated at the same place?

  

"Tracing the historical appearance of such forms will also be important, since it is likely that many Jñāpakas are trying to justify forms that did not exist in the times of earlier grammarians including Pāṇini himself"

  

Thus I am of the opinion that one has to start from the dhatupatha itself to see what phonetic changes took place in the phonation of letters which got reflected in the various diverse word forms which evolved later.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
