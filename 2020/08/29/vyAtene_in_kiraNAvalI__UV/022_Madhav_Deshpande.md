Dear Achyut Ji,

  

  You have raised important questions. However, the answers to your questions are not easy to come up with. You seem to assume that we have in our hands an absolutely authentic Pāṇinian version of the Dhātupāṭha. That assumption is not quite correct. The Dhātupāṭha and the Gaṇapāṭha have come to us in various versions, and several scholars like Palsule and Kapil Dev Dwivedi have done extensive comparative work on these various versions. Along with phonetics, there is regional variation in the use of different verbs, already noted by Patañjali and Yāska, and then a circular relationship between Prakritand Sanskrit, words passing back and forth between these different layers of languages. Much of the research relating to your questions is scattered in numerous publications, and you may need to begin reading such works.
With best wishes,
