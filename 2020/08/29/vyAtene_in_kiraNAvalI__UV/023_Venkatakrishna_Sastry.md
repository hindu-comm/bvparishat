Namaste



1. I agree with Prof.Deshpandes observation on the following points. There are critical national, cultural and academic 'benefit of this study beyond a schoalrly satisfaction and tradition-toeing argument'.

 If our own understanding is incomplete, what are we going to train the next generation to be ?



 a. doubs on authentic Pāṇinian version of the Dhātupāṭha and the Gaṇapāṭha

 b. regional variation

 c. a circular relationship between Prakritand Sanskrit, words passing back and forth between these different layers of languages



2. I want to add some more points which need to get covered in this
proposed research (a work under progress quielty at our school).



 2a) multiply broken down , forced distortions and discordant understanding of the Samskruth-Prakruth grammar relations 

 2b) difficulties in patching up in house divides of ' Vyakarana schools itself as kashikaa- kaumudi… traditions ( even if it is assumed one),

 2c) The lack of understanding ' Munitraya reason' for insisting on maintaining the internal harmony in understanding the
unification of 'Chandas (vedic) and Bhashaa

(Classical Paninian Sanskrit). i.e. Vedangataa of Vyakarana and inclusive aproach with Shikshaa and Nirukta and Jyotisha??



Probaly, unless we consciously make up our mind to go back to source understandings prior to Sayana Maadhava ( of Vijayanaagar empire and Veda Bhashya Chief Editor), we may have serious handicap in exploring this domain.



Do we still have any surviving ' Indigenous scholar'Veda' base / Schools \[ and not Vedanta -schools which have left out the Vijnana part for ' sunischitaartha' and prefering 'sannyasa' over yoga part,
who can help the study of Vednaga Vyakarana and restore Shadanga Vedanga, needed for a 'Brahmana Karma/ Samskara paddhati ? How can we keep the ' spicing of Vedanta flavors' on langauge- grammar studies'?



Why are we as ' Native team and inheritors/ trustees/ proud owners of
shaastra -sampradaya' not able to recognize-restore- rejuvenate indigenously to bring out the wisdom of Acharya Madhva about the ' Langauge grammars of Samskruth? and 'Shaastra-paddhati' ? Why speak of ' Hanumat- Vyakarana' and invoke it after a time lapse of some millennia? Why are we locked to ' Panini only - as sole or partial authority to interpret Vedas and Gita'? Why have we relgated Yaska
Nirukta - Nirvacahana sampradaya and isolated it? Why love for aligning
language-grammar to Vedanta end only?



Does it not look like a historical anchronism and hermeneutic error
? \[ I recall this as one of the focused articulations made by Prof.Witzel in a private conversation with me on ' 'How to-' issue to get at the Meaning of Vedas, before venturing to his visoned translation of Vedas in to one of the european langauges'.\] -\[ <http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/>

What can we all do together to resolve this issue ?
