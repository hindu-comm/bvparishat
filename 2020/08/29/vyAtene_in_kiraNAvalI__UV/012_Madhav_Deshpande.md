This has been a very valuable discussion. It brings up the fact that all commentators are trying their best to reconcile the intention of Pāṇini as they understand with the facts of usage as they know. It may be a worthy research project to undertake a history of Jñāpakas beginning with Kātyāyana and coming all the way to more recent grammarians like Nāgeśabhaṭṭa. When does a Jñāpaka appear and to justify what forms? Tracing the historical appearance of such forms will also be important, since it is likely that many Jñāpakas are trying to justify forms that did not exist in the times of earlier grammarians including Pāṇini himself. With best regards,
