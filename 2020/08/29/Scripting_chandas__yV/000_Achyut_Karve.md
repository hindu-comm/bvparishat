Dear Vidwans,

  

While documenting the compositions of the tabla which are chandas we faced a serious problem.. The problem was that when someone was asked to read the compositions one could not read the composition as desired in the proper meter.

  

Transposing this fact onto Sanskrit it appears that after it became a practice to write chandas or Sanskrit (prose) the way in which it is recited or read might not be the way it is intended. Further when the swara markings are overlooked the problem becomes more acute.

  

The question is whether the existing script for Sanskrit (devanagari)
is sufficient to accuratelyreflect the nicetiesof the tongue. In other words is the existing Siksha sufficient to overcome this insufficiency of the script.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
