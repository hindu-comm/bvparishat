Dear Vidwans,

  

To put the question more directly can a notation really depict a language. Is it comparable to how the human brain transforms an image into a word form which carries the intended visual image? The sound which the tabla produces when percussedis completely mimicked with the help of a sequence of letters. Therefore percussion instruments like the tabla, pakhawaj and mridungacannot be learnt without both memorization of the composition as well as reciting them properly. One may create a notation if one wants to however it cannot become a basis of instruction. The main problem that arises is that when one writes one is least interested to know how it will be read. At the same time when a person writes he only provides cues to how it should be recited.
If the student is not instructed how to read what has been written, that is in the absence of a Shiksha Patha differences in articulation of the written word will happen from generation to generation and from individual to individual.

  

My point is that from the time that writing has been in use to transfer knowledge from one generation to another there arose changes in how a language is spoken. Thus the instability or variation in languages occur not because languages are naturally given to changes over time but because writing which is a sort of notation has been used in its transfer. On account of which there is no concordance in the speech of the writer and that of the reader.

  

For example in countries like the USA and UK rigorous training is provided to the child before he really takes to writing and reading. 1) Does there exist any such training for teaching, any of the
Indian formal languages. 2) Is there any such standard training practice used to teach Sanskrit. 3) Do any of the existing shikshas satisfy this need? The shikshas are but a broad description of the articulatory process. 4) How can one expect to use it for instruction for reading and writing Sanskrit when the student is already loaded with its mother tongue. 5) Are we going to seek a remedy to overcome this practical difficulty. Is Sanskrit a single language having a unique tongue or it exists as English like UK English, American English, Marathi English, Tamil English, Hindi English, etc. 

  

The solution ought to be practical and instructable. A paper or a thesis will not serve any purpose. Else linguists will continue to believe and say that languages naturally undergo change.

If you hear and read the above video one will notice how the sound produced on the tabla exactly mimic the letters in the composition.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
