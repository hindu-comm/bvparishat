Dear Mr. Goswami,

  

If you are looking for a short prakaranagrantha, I'd suggest Nandisvara's Prabhakaravijaya. Here is the link to it:

Apart from that, you can also read Ahobalasuri's Vakyartharatna with the autocommentary, Suvarnamudrika:

You can also read Mm. Pt. Mani Dravid Sastriji's Sanskrit vivrti on the Tarkapada of Parthasarathimisra's Sastradipika, which explains the Prabhakara purvapaksa very clearly.

  

Besides, Prof. Elisa Freschi's annotated English translation and study of the Sastraprameyapariccheda of Ramanuja's Tantrarahasya will be of immemse help.

  

Last but not the least, if you want to read about Prabhakara's theory of sentence-meaning and sentence-compositionality, the latter halves of the 5th and 6th chapters of Jayantabhatta's Nyāyamañjarī prove to be an excellent place to look at.

  

I have not mentioned Salikanathamisra's Prakaranapancika for specific reasons which require detailed explanation.

  

Hope this helps.

  

Best regards,

Yours very sincerely

  

Sudipta Munsi
