K.S. Ramaswamy Sastri's Introduction to his edition of Rāmānujācārya's Tantra-Rahasya published in the Gaekwad Oriental Series is an excellent introduction to Prābhākara Mīmāṃsā, besides the book by Ganganath Jha mentioned earlier by Professor Girish Jha. This book is also available at archive-org.
