Dear Shri Goswami,

  

  Prabhākara's commentary Br̥hatī on Śābara-Bhāṣya has been published by Chowkhamba as well as in the Madras Oriental Series in multiple volumes, many of them available on [archive.org](http://archive.org).
Also a prominent work of Prābhākara-Mīmāṃsā is Śālikanātha's Prakaraṇa-Pañcikā, also available on [archive.org](http://archive.org).
With best wishes for your studies,
