Dear Dr.Shankar,

  

One of my senior colleagues in Oriental Institute,Baroda,the late Dr.B.N.Bhatt,worked for his Ph.D.on Shrikanthacharitamo of Mankha and the book was published in early 1970s or 1980s.

  

Pl.keep me informed about your progress.

  

Did you publish your thesis on a novel topic.

  

Best of luck in your intellectual pursuits.

  

Prof.Siddharth Y.Wakankar.
