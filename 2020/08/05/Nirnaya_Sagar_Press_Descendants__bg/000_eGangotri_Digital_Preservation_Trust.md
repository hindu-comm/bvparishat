Dear All:

  

Anyone know about the descendants of Nirnay Sagar Press Folks.

  

I was able to trace the 2 different streams of Naval Kishore Family's Descendants - and also a Muslim gentleman who had married one of there daughters.

  

The Khemraj folks are still operational in Mumbai. I spoke to Vinod Sharma ji who is there 4th generation manager.

  

I am trying to gather as much information as possible about Old Publishing Houses.

  

Even obscure publishers like Sanskriti Sansthan, Khwaja Kutub, Bareilly.

  

Thanks and regards.
