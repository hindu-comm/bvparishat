Dear Madhav,

  

As Damodara Dasa mentioned, the Udyogaparvan has also been published. Here is a wetransfer link:

I think these may be the only two parvans to be published in this way, with these commentaries. But I would be delighted

if there is more.

  

It is really a pity that much of the commentarial literature on theMahābhārata has still not been printed....

  

All the best,

  

Haru
