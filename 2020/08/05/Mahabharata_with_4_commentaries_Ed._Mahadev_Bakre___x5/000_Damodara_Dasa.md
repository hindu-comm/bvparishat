Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
Some time back I have downloaded (I don't know from where) a pdf file  
of the Book:  
"Sriman Mahabharatam, Udyogaparvan V" with collected commentaries from  
Nilakantha, Arjuna Mishra, Vimalabodha, Sarvajna Narayana, and  
Vadiraja (Laksalankara).  
  
It is edited by Mahadev Gangadhar Bhatta Bakre  
Published and Printed by  
Manilal Itcharam Desai at the  
Gujarati Printing Press, Bombay  
in 1920 A.D.  
  
Attached is sample of this file.  
  
I wanted other parvans from same publishers if they have rendered them  
in the same manner. If anyone has any knowledge of these volumes, then  
I would request to share that.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
