Devabodha's commentary on Ādiparvan (<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.279878>), Sabhāparvan, and Bhīṣmaparvan

was published, in three separate volumes, from BORI. His commentary on Udyogaparvan was published, not from BORI,

but from the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan in Bombay, edited by S.K. De (who edited the Udyogaparvan of the Critical Edition).
