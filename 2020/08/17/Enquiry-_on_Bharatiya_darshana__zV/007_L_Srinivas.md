Likewise it is surprising that in 100+ years we dont have more recent popular books that could be used by students. No doubt these books are useful but S Radhakrishnan's two volumes were published in 1923 and 1927. M Hiriyanna's 'Outlines' was published in 1932.  

  

In heavily Sanskrit text oriented subjects like 'tarkasangrah' etc, we do get a new book (if only in Hindi) every 10 years. In reality, once in 5 years since the new books with 'Dipika' commentary and 'Nyayabodhini' commentary alternate. In vyakarana, we get a new introductory text every 10-20 years - at least for the laghukaumudi. It is surprising then that a general English language subject like college level 'Indian Philosophy' hardly gets new texts.  

  

'Classical Indian Philosophy' by JN Mohanty, written in 2000, is a pretty lucid text . I dont think however that it has an Indian edition.
