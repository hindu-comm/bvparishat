**Although the usage of the term 'अप्रत्ययः' as 'अविधीयमानः' is not to be found anywhere else in the Aṣṭādhyāyī, it is done here simply because the commentators have said so. Which commentators? Originally Kaiyaṭa Upādhyāya and then later commentators such as Bhaṭṭojī.**

**  
**

**Patañjali comments —अप्रत्यय इति किमर्थम्?**

**  
**

**Kaiyaṭa comments on Patañjali and says —किं यस्य प्रत्ययसंज्ञा विहिता तस्य प्रतिषेधः उत यः प्रतीयते = विधीयते इति यौगिकः प्रत्ययस्तस्यापीति प्रश्नः ।**

**  
**

**Bhaṭṭojī also says on this sūtra —प्रतीयते विधीयते इति प्रत्ययः ।**

**  
**

**So it is only by the words of the commentators such as Kaiyaṭa (and others who follow him) that we come to know that apratyayaḥ should be interpreted as avidhīyamānaḥ here. No other way to know.**

**The reason for saying that अप्रत्ययः applies only to अण् and not to उदित् is that in case of उदित् , it doesn't matter if it is विधीयमानः orअविधीयमानः . In both cases, the उदित् will refer to itsसवर्णs . For example , in the sūtraचोः कुः (8.2.30),चु is अविधीयमानः whereas कु is विधीयमानः , but still both of them refer to their respective सवर्णs. Seeing this, the commentators have limited the applicability of अप्रत्ययः only to अण् .**

**Whenever इत् occurs at the end of a samāstapada in Aṣṭādhyāyī, it is interpreted as bahuvrīhi. इत् is also applied to certain verbal roots in Dhātupāṭha but in those cases it is not a samastapada.**
