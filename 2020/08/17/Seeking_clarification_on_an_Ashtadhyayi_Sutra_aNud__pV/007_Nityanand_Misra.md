What isNāgeśa Bhaṭṭa's final conclusion on the matter? The *Tattvabodhinī*has contradicted the view that the compound is*bahuvrīhi*. It appears Nāgeśais quoting somebody else’s view which he does not see favourably as evinced by the use of *tu* (*anye tu*...), but the full context needs to be looked at. Can you share the context or archive link where the paragraph occurs (I think it is from the *Bṛhacchabdenduśekhara*)?

  

Also, what is your opinion? Do you agree withMahābhāṣya, Kāśikā, etc. or the view of others cited by Nāgeśa?
