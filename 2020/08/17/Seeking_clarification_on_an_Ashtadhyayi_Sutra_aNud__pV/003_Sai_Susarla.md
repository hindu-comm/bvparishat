DhanyavaadaH mahodaya!

Very nice paper that goes into the depth of the issues I was grappling with.

  

Regarding my question 2, is my understanding correct that since "pratyayaH" is a viSheShaNa in prathama vibhakti, it only refers to the first visheShya, namely, aN and doesn't include the next one udit? Otherwise it should have been  
अणुदित् सवर्णस्य च अप्रत्ययौ ?

\- Sai.
