My answer to the the original question was based on the assumption thatइत् is at the end of a samasta-pada without applying any vibhakti besides prathamā, because when a vibhakti such as saptamī is applied, then the commentators can give various interpretations out of it based on whether it is para-saptamī, viṣaya-saptamī etc. and then we end up with variegated opinions. Moreover, there is also the variegatedness of prasajya-pratiṣedha and paryudāsa-pratiṣedha here. Even in this rare exception for the formation of जग्ले etc.,शित् inअशिति can also optionally be interpreted asबहुव्रीहिः and Śrī Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa has specified this option. I have attached the relevant excerpt. Although these opinions quoted by him can also be contested, it is better to find an example of a इत् term at the end of a non-bahuvrīhi samāsa in a sūtra where there are no variations in interpretation.

This should be कर्मधारयात्सप्तमी , not कर्मदारयात्सप्तमी.
