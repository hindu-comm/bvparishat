namo namaH,

I have several questions regarding interpretation of the Ashtadhyayi sutra 1.1.69

अणुदित् सवर्णस्य च अप्रत्ययः

  

<https://www.ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/1/1/69>

I am referring to the above website, which, BTW, is a huge help as it keeps all vyaakhyas in one place and also provides a "putting it all together" explanation.  

  

Here are the questions. I am bowled over by this sutra's interpretation because it creates an inconsistency in a methodology to interpret the sutras which was working well otherwise.

  

I'd be very grateful to scholars for quick help you can provide on these questions. Please Cc' me in your reply as I don't receive BVP individual mails.  

  

1\) apratyayaH means avidhiiyamaanaH. Then how to distinguish between a reference to "pratyaya" as a samjna referring to pratyaya list within Ashtadhyayi vs. the above connotation of the word? Is the word used in the above connotation at any other places in Ashtadhyayi? Which?  

  

2\) The above website says that अप्रत्ययः applies only to अण् and not to उदित् .

What is the reference for that interpretation? At other places, when multiple prathama vibhakti padas are in a sutra, one of them is a visheshya and others are visheshanas and they seems apply to all components of visheshya.  

  

3\) उदित् is in bahuvriihi samaasa here - उकारः यस्मिन् इत्संज्ञकः अस्तिः सः उदित्  

Does it mean that whenever इत् occurs in a samasta pada it has to be interpreted that way only? Does Ashtadhyayi have an encoding convention to indicate which samaasa is employed where?

  

mahaan dhanyavaadaH,

\- Sai.
