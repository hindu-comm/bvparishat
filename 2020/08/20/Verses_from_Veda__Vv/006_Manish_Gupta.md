Thanks Manish ji.  I am curious what unique maarg/path is that the Rishi is talking about.

  

This Shloka is in complete contradiction to the common perception prevailing, among Hindus and intellectuals, these days that there are thousandsof paths available to God realisation.

  

Kind regards,

MAnish
