Namaskar

  

I cannot translate sanskrut.

  

As per our discussion on the group, ketu is considered to be the most malefic planet; and not saturn.

  

So, can we say that as ketu is the (considered as) the most malefic planet, it is the 'head'/ kind of leader of malefics?

  

Thanks and Regards

Rucha Kelkar
