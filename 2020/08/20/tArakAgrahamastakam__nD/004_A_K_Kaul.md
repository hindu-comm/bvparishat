Shri Pankaj Vyasji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< then how do you interpret headless body is Rahu.>

Kethu is a very late entry in the Hindu astronomical works as well.
There is no mention of Kethu in the Surya Siddhanta or any other siddhantas!

In fact, even Varahamihira is silent about Kethu as a counterpart of Rahu, since mostly he has talked about Kethu as comets!

But astronomically, "Rahu" and "Kethu" are always away by 180 degrees from one another! In astrology, Kethu is even Mokshakaraka, apart from being a "malefic".  

Then again, astronomically, Rahu has True motion, whereas no Hindu astronomical work has talked about the same!

\< In which purana head is interpreted as Ketu>

Pl. give me sometime to get back to you, as I will have to glean it from the Pauranic lore, which I had gone through several decades back!

  

राहुरेव शिर:पदार्थ: किल if taken literally, then calling Kethu as "tara-graha-mastaka" is not feasible, since one of them has to be the body/tail and the other as head!

  

However, I may mention here that though astrologyis supposed to be based on astronomy, but they are actually poles apart.

E.g. the planets and Rahu and Kethu of predictive astrology are supposed to be deities with miraculous powers of causing miseries or benefits to even the nations, not only individuals, but astronomical planets like Mangal and Shani and Rahu etc. are inanimate wandering bodies, whose motions can be determined thousands of years before and after the actual "event" through modern astronomy. 

In astronomy even the "Devaguru" Brihaspti is subject to hammerings by comets like Shoemaker-Levy 9!

And as is common knowledge, we have already landed on the Moon and Mangal is our next target!

May be that is why Shri Vinay Jha, a great scholar of siddhantic astronomy, especially the Surya Siddhanta, apart from being a well known astrologer, insists that the planets of predictive astrology are not to be confused with the planets of modern astronomy or even the Surya Siddhanta!

**Astrological versus Physical Planets**

All concepts from Physical Astronomy (such as Super Moon or rays of visible Sun &c) come from the FAITH in the SENSORILY PERCEIVED PHYSICAL (MATERIAL) things which is so rampant now-a-days due to propaganda by physical scientists against Astrology. If changes in distance of Moon should have astrological effect. so should have the respective distances of all planets. Then, farther planets should not have any appreciable astrological effect on Earth. For instance, physical Saturn is 3713 times farther than the Moon, and according to inverse square law, its gravitational and other physical forces should be proportional to inverse of square of distance, ie Saturn's physical forces should be 13784230 times less than those of Moon for equal mass. But Saturn is 95 times heavier than Earth and Earth is 81 times heavier than Moon, hence Saturn is nearly 7700 times heavier than Moon. Therefore, Saturn's actual physical (gravitational, electromagnetic) forces should be 13784230 divided with 7700 = 1790 times weaker than those of Moon, which is too high to allow Saturn to exert any perceptible impact on Earth with respect to Moon. Only Sun and Moon have compararable physical forces acting on Earth, Moon being the strongest, and all other planets are thousands of times weaker. But in astrology, if astrological factors like uchchādi or aspects are the same then astrological impacts are same for all planets. Hence, physical characteristics of planets like size, mass, distance, gravitation, electric force, magnetism, etc have ZERO role in astrology. It is only a deliberate design of God to give same name to astrological and physical planets so that materialists remain confused and do not get the benefits of a divine discipline like Jyotisha. The only proper way to study astrology is to follow the philosophy and guidelines laid down by rishi-based classics and other supportive texts, without tampering with the fundamental tenets of astrology. All astrological tests should be based purely on ASTROLOGICAL criteria and not on materialist criteria, because material objects do not possess astrological properties according to any scientific study in the world (and the reverse is also true ; astrological planets do not have material or physical properties, as shown above).
