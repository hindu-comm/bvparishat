Shri B R Hnbhatji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<The compound occurs in नवग्रहस्तोत्र in in respect of Ketu. How तारकाग्रहमस्तकम् can mean? It is seen translated as "the head of planets and stars" in many places>

As per the Pauranic lore, during the "*sagara-manthana*", after the "jar" of Amrita(Nectar) had come out of the same, Bhagwan Vishnu, as Mohini, started distributing it among "Devas" in a que.

Rahu, an Asura, is said to have infiltrated that que of Devas, and he was pointed out by the sun and the moon to Bhagwan Vishnu. The latter beheaded Rahu with his Sudarshana Chakra, but since Rahu had sipped some Amruta, he had become immortal. As his head got separatedby Sudarshana Chakra from his body, itbecame known as Kethu and the headless body continued to be known as Rahu. Thus Keth is "mastaka" of Rahu as per the Puranas.

It is also said that since that very day Rahu and Kethu started "devouring" the sun and the moon --- i.e. they started eclipsing the two luminaries!

Astronomically, however, Rahu and Kethu are known as the North and South node of the moon and they are just mathematical points of zero dimensions,without any head or "tail"!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
