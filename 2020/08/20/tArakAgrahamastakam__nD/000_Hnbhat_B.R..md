The compound occurs in नवग्रहस्तोत्र in in respect of Ketu. How तारकाग्रहमस्तकम् can mean? It is seen translated as "the head of planets and stars" in many places. But the questions raised here is Sun is known as of the head of grahas and the moon as the stars. Hence how can Ketu can be called as head who himself the headless?

  

Any clarification is welcome. If there is another different interpretation?
