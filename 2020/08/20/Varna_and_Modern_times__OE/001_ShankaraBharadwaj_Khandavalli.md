Sri Shivakumar is right in calling jati as more organized than varna, but they are two different phenomena: one is macro and abstract, not an organization, hence finds place in the "sanatana"/eternal layer. Jati is a temporal reality which is subject to evolution.  

  

"varna vyavastha" and "varna was birth based" was where I was lost. First, varna dharma is the term used traditionally, not as an organization. H society was/is not "organized" and we started seeing it as an organized one of late. The moment we define it as an organization, it does not warrant reinstatement no matter what the merits because state needs to adopt it. All organized systems need reform and eventual replacement as society evolves.   

  

The idea that individualism finds kula restrictive is not very valid. Restriction and constrainment is primarily resource related, and what society saw because of subjugation rather than what individuals saw because of society. This is another major conflation that has not been dealt with (not in the article but in general by scholarship).  

  

Whether kula will be seen as an occupational unit or not is what changes. It ends up being a cultural sub unit and its occupational relevance is lost. As such it does not matter much because neither the kula nor the occupation has much relevance in the modern state claims to be agnostic of both (that it is not is a different matter).
