Namaskara

  

I came across 'Asiatick Researches or Transactions Volume 6' (published in 1801), where on page 510 it is mentioned that there is a place of sage Garga which is fourteen coss from Cabul, situated in the mountains, as told by some pilgrims. It is called 'Garga-sthan', which has been noted by Persian authors as Ghergistan (this is the popular name of the mountains).

  

Is there any more information regarding the history behind the name of this mountain and the relation of sage Garga with it?

  

Kindly guide

  

Regards
