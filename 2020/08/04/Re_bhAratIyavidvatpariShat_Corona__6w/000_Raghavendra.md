Nice, but the last sentence - \*Kill this Corona causing darkness in the world\*.

  

I think it should be,

  

Kill this Corona, which is causing darkness in the world.  
  
Thank you and best regards,

Corona

  

यत्स्पर्शात् विकला सकला जनता भवति

कोरोनेयं कुत आयाता यमभगिनी ।

धाव त्वरया माधव रक्षेमामवनीम्

तां संसारध्वान्तकरीं जहि कोरोनाम् ।।

  

Where did Corona, the sister of Death, come from? Her contact frightens the people. O Krishna, rush quickly and save this world. Kill this Corona causing darkness in the world.
