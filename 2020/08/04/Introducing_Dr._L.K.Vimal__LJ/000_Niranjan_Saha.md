Respected Members,

  

Namaste!

  

Professor S.S.Suryanarayana Sastri has dedicated his work on Sankhyakaraika thus:

                       

                            To

                     The Race of Pandits

              Who despite the neglect and contumely

                   That have fallen to their lot

                       Have kept alight the

                        Lamp of Learning

                          In Our Land

  

  

To justify Professor Sastri I introduce Shri Lakshmi Kant Vimal ([vimal\_...@yahoo.com]()) to you all. He hails from a pandit family in Darbhanga, Bihar, has qualified UGC-NET and done his MPhil (DU), PhD (JNU) in Sanskrit on Sankara Vedanta. He's in his early forties and possesses an indomitable spirit to propagate shastra-s etc. He's engaged in self-study and research and has published a number of books, eg.,Advaitanubhutiwith Hindi translation and explanation (2011,Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratishthan, New Delhi), Manishapanchakam with Hindi translation and explanation (2016 Chaukhamba Sanskrit Pratishthan, New Delhi). He lives in NCR (Hariyana) with his family.

But he still couldn't manage a suitable/decent job to run his family, let alone doing shastra-s etc. While he's self-content and is unlikely to approach others (thinking that thesituation is usual for the pandits/sanskritists), I'm writing to you all if you could help him out in finding a job.

  

  

With sincere regards,

Niranjan
