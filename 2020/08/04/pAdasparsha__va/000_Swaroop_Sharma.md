I request scholars to give references to the practice of falling at feet.

  

Are there Shlokas which define the purpose of the same?

  

Are there references which suggest, the destruction of one's own ego by falling at someone's feet.

  

Also, is it exclusively stated anywhere, that, falling at someone's feet is necessarily when the one who is falling is inferior? Thus, is this action between a superior & inferior?

  

Further, is there a reference that suggests the reason behind falling only at the feet? Why not touch other body part like hand, head etc.

  

  

Kindly forgive if the question appears naive
