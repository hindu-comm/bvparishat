नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Do you know Telugu ? Simply readingwill not do or take the help of a person who knows Telugu well .

  

वस्तुगुणदीपिक(Telugu) is a book in which you get the names of different things you are asking for in Telugu - Latin/English - Sanskrit and Hindi.

  

Address : S B S Publishwers, Main road , Rajamahendravaram(Rajahmundry) East Godavari Dt , Andhra Pradesh - 533101

(11th Edition 2004 Rs 360 pp 1143)

This is an indispensablebook for every household . I don't think such a book is there in any other vernacular .
