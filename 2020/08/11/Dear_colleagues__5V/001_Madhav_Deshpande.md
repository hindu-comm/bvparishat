I would also be interested in these two books. Thanks. As an aside, recently one of my portable drives failed and I lost a sizable collection of downloaded pdf files. The lesson I learned is that every drive needs a backup drive. Fortunately, most of those pdfs are there on Archive.org, Scribd etc., but searching takes a lot of time. With best regards,
