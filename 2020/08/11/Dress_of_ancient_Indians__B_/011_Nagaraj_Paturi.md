There were bad /cruel/villainous subordinate relers /officials even in older times:

  

The following story recorded in a Kaifiyat (local chronicle) that historians call Machupalli Kaifiyat:

  

One of the paraphrasingsof a portion of the Kaifiyat is on this website:

*1**502 A.D., Vijayanagaram (present Hampi)  
***

***A Bhagavata Mela troupe was getting ready to give its performance to an august audience including the King, Sri Veera Narasimha Rayalu. The Indradhwaja was hoisted, the Jarjara brought out. The Sootradhaari started his invocation. Yet everybody backstage were in a pensive mood. It was question of life or death. Leaving that answer to Gods, the characters stepped out in their Pravesha Daruvus.***

***For what they depicted was not a mythological story, but the atrocities of Sambeta Guravaraju of Siddhavatam, whose cruelties knew no bounds. *It is said, he used to lance the breasts of the wives of revenue defaulters in his area.* With a very realistic and convincing portrayal, the Bhagavatulu alerted the King to the misgovernance of his aide. Within days, Sambeta Guravaraju was suitably and ruthlessly punished.***

***The Bhagavatulu’s contribution to delivering the people of Siddhavatam from their tormentor has been immortalised in the Machupalli Kaifiyat of 1502 A.D.***

  

The Travancore incident too seems to be part of such a cruel way of tax collection.
