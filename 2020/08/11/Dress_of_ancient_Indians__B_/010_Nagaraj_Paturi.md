Sri Radhakrishna Warrior-ji says,

  

"the mulakkaram was just a name for the tax expected from a female, just as the talakkaram was the tax expected from the male. Talakkaram was levied not for the privilege of covering the head, or because someone chose to cover the head, just a mulakkaram was levied ***not for*** covering the mula (breast) or because some of these tribal women chose to cover their breasts."

  

(highlighting mine)

  

Thats a sensible reasoning.
