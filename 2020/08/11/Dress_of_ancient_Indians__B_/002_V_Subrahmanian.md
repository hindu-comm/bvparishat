This information is interesting in the sense that I have wondered why when the Brahmin women of the Tamil, Kannada and Telugu regions have different kinds of 'Kaccha' sari (called 'maDisaar' in Tamil, two distinct styles among women of Smarta (Iyer) and Vaishnava (Iyengar), 'melukacche' of Madhvas (which is followed by women of Maharashtra and some Smartas in some parts of Karnataka), 'oLa kacche' (inner-kaccha) by Smarta women of Karnataka and a completely different style by Andhra women, there is no such distinct 'kaccha' by Brahmin (Nambuthiri) women of Kerala?' The information you provide gives the answer: it is inner kaccha within the muNDu. However, I also came across an external kaccha, as shown in this short video:

Not sure if this kaccha for women is there among Bengali and UP and other regions.
