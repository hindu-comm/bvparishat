The "mulakkaram" or breast tax is just fraud propaganda. So is the story that started circulating around the 2019 election time of a Nangeli who cut off and presented her breasts to the powers that be as a protest. Looks like those who circulate these stories staunchly believe in Goebbels. Circulate it as many times, and lo, one day it becomes the truth. Like the story of Tippu Sultan "who fought for India's freedom" and "protected Hindus". This Goebbels-like propaganda has now sneaked into even textbooks.

It is interesting that among the elite classes of north India, for a long time after the beginning of the Kushan empire, trousers were in fashion (as in current times). Even samudragupta is depicted in such attire.

  

Also, in case of keraLa, this topic is interesting for another reason - the inimical fraud propaganda about breast tax - <https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/the-recurring-myth-of-breast-tax-doesnt-seem-to-die-down-this-time-propagated-by-scroll/>
