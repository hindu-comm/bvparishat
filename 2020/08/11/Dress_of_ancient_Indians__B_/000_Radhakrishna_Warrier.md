This topic might have been discussed here but another discussion would not be a waste. 

What did ancient Indians wear? How did the dress evolve through centuries? The dress would have been different in different parts of India. What did Pāṇini in the north wear? His dress would have been different in summer and winter. What was the dress of the women of his times? What did Tolkāppiyar in the south wear? His dress wouldn’t have been any different in summer or winter. Again, what did the women of his times wear?

In Kerala, the dress was very simple from the very ancient times. Kings and commoners dressed themselves very similarly. For males it was a muṇdu or dhoti wound around the waist. Beneath would be a kaupīnam. On the upper body would be an uttarīyam which is a piece of cloth thrown over the shoulder. Females also wound a muṇdu around the waist (no sari in ancient and premodern Kerala). Beneath would be atāṟŭ or taṯṯŭ (a kind of kaccha) in the case of females of the higher social classes and perhaps nothing in the case of the lower social classes. Pāvāḍa (under skirt) came much later.There could be an optional cloth tied around the chest called the mulakkacca (breast covering) over which would be thrown a piece of cloth like the uttarīyam.

In Kerala, it was in the past 150 years that men began wearing shirts and women began wearing blouses. Pants for men came much later, perhaps just 50 years ago.
