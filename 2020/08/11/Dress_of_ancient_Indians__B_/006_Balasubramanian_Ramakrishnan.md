Dear Sri Radhakrishnan

  

This is not a new tale by any means. I remember one of my classmates at IIT telling this same tale to me in the late 80s. I am sure this is present in some fake "history textbook" or the other since my friend is a voracious reader (no internet in India in the late 80s, not even cable TV). Fake "history textbook" is of course a misnomer since most of school history texts in India are full of outright fake stuff or extremely misleading stuff.

  

Ramakrishnan
