Dear list members isjayantī in its meaning as birthday (i.e.kṛṣṇa-jayantī,ganeśa-jayantī etc.) sanskrit? I had always assumed that to be the case but a sanskritist told me thatjayantī as birthday was marathi and not sanskrit . I did not see an entry for
jayantī in Apte's dictionary or in Boehtlink-Roth but Monier-Williams had ahanumaj—jayantīf.the day of full moon of the month Caitra (being the supposed birthday of Hanumat)

  

Thanks,

Dear Harry,

  

  There is a text titled*Jayantī-Kalpaḥ*ascribed to Madhvācārya.
It dealswith the festival of Kr̥ṣṇāṣṭamī. So I assume that the word is at least as old as that work, and probably older.

Dear Harry,

  

See the following verse from the Harivaṃśa (I copy-pasted from GRETIL for ease):

  

abhijin nāma nakṣatraṃ jayantī nāma śarvarī \| \*HV_48.15\*598:1 \|  
muhūrto vijayo nāma yatra jāto janārdanaḥ \|\| \*HV_48.15\*598:2 \|  

  

Regards,

This is my understanding of the development of the term jayanti -

*Stage I – Jayantī = Śrījayantī*

Presumably the older sense of Jayantīis interchangeable with Śrījayantī . This latter term refers only to the utsava celebrating the birthday of Kṛṣṇa – the dark aṣtamī \[or rohiṇi asterism\] of the Śrāvaṇa/Bhādrapada month. This use of Śrījayantīin this sense still prevails among the brahmana-s and other Hindu groups of Tamiḻ-speaking territories. This suggests that Śrījayantī was probably*the*archetypical jayantī \].

Besides the usage by Madhvacārya-Pūrṇaprajña (1238–1317), the term is attested in the ouvre of Veṅkaṭanātha-Vedāntadeśika 1268–1369. The first verse of Gopālaviṁśati repeated at the beginning of and Yādavābhyudaya uses the term jayantī unmistakably in the sense ofŚrījayantī .

*vande brndāvanacaram vallavījanavallabhaṃ \|*

*jayantīsambhavaṃ dhāma vaijayantīvibhūṣaṇam \|\|*

The term is attested in a Siṁhācalam inscription ofNarahari Tīrtha (1243-1333) where it is not clear if the expression Śrījayantīof śrīnarasiṁhanātha refers to the Kṛṣṇajayantīor to the Narasiṁhajayantī .

*Stage II – The Birthday boom*

The appearance of the termjayantīin an extended sense increases in theinscriptions ofVijayanagara times \[\~ 14^(th)century onwards\]and it is attachedto other deities - Kūrma, Narasimha, Rāma and Vāmana, for example.

*Stage III – Ossified in Government Parlance*

Currently, the term is lexicalized in the lingua franca of Indian bureaucratese and applied to the remembrance days of all important (dead) personages -Buddha, Mahāvīra, Śaṅkara-, Basava, Gandhi and Ambedkar(illustrative list). There is also a G*ītājayantī*to celebrate the ‘birth anniversary’ of the Bhagavad gītā.

The term in modern usage has the additional denotation of jubilee or anniversary. For example Svarṇa jayantī and Rajata jayantī for Golden Jubilee and Silver Jubilee.
