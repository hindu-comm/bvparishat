Namaskar,

  

I wish to clear my doubts on certain aspects. I believe that this is a extremely good forum toput across the doubts.

  

As mentioned in the subject line, I have questions in my mind:

  

1\. Whether women should abstain from reciting vedic mantras/ shlokas?

  

The question hasn't stemmed from the modern concept of feminism, that women can and should do everything. I am not asking from that point ofview. The question is whether women 'should' or 'should not', not 'can' or 'cannot'.

  

In our country people never did anything just casually. Every aspect of our life was well thought, there was a lot of 'manthan' that has happened and all our philosophy is extremely well tried and tested. Each and every living organism has been deeply revered and worshipped. We use the term 'mother' for nature. Everything and everyone was respected and worshipped, women were certainly not an exception.

  

Various rituals are performed in various occasions; where vedic mantras/ shlokas are recited, which may include beej mantras as well. These rituals/ recitation of mantras have been performed by accomplished and knowledgeable brahman men. In majority, we see only men performing such rituals, of course after their upnayan ceremony. We all know that Gaargi and Maitreyi were a few women who wrote several verses of vedas. Accordingly, it is no hidden fact that women are as much capable to recite vedic mantras. Women can recite puranic mantras, as believed by a large section of society. Moreover, going back several thousand yearsago, there was 'matrusattak' society. Women weren't considered less than men, neither men were considered any less. Hence there was no question of supression.

  

It is believed by many that in order to suppress women, men started saying that women shouldn't recite vedic mantras.

  

There is also a thought that chanting vedic mantras instantly generates energy within the body. Women are not biologically equipped to take this energy; it may hamper their reproductive system.

  

But as mentioned earlier women scholars like Gaargi and Maitreyi wrote vedas and also recited them. So, did women of that era not face the same problem? Is there a solution to this issue?

  

I humbly state again that these questions are not asked to criticise, but to clearly understand the point and have an unbiased view on the matter.

  

Further, what are the mantras that women can recite? For eg., I recite the 'Chaakshushopanisht' 12 times. It is in Rigveda. So should women recite it? Further, there are various shlokas/ mantras like Shree sukta, Purusha sukta, Vishnu sahastranaam, Rudra, etc. Shree sukta, like other vedic mantras, has to be recited in a certain way, there are 'swar' for the same. Furthermore, all the vedic mantras have to be pronounced clearly, else it is meaningless.

  

So can women recite the mantras mentioned above? What are the mantras women should not recite?

  

Request you to throw light on the questions and provide guidance.

  

Thank you very much for your patient reading.

  

Warm regards

Rucha Kelkar
