Chapter 1

Psychophysiological Effects and the Applications of Yoga Breathing Practices

Niranjan Kala, Dipak Chetry, Shirley Telles

Yoga is an ancient practice which originated in India and aims at purifying the mind for spiritual progress. In modern times yoga is widely practiced for general health and well-being as well as for therapeutic reasons. Voluntary breath regulation or pranayama has been given significant importance in traditional texts as well as by yoga masters. Research has shown beneficial effects of yoga breathing practices or pranayamas on neurocognitive, metabolic, respiratory and autonomic functions which are discussed in the chapter. The chapter also discusses the applications of these practices for the management of various clinical conditions as well as for alleviating psychological problems associated with particular illnesses. The beneficial effects of yoga breathing practices demonstrate the importance of these safe and cost effective non-pharmacological interventions for general health as well as for prevention and management of various diseases.

Chapter 2

Psychophysiology: Healing Effects of Voluntarily Regulated Breathing Practices

Heather Mason, Patricia Gerbarg, Richard Brown

This chapter describes the physiological mechanisms, which underpin the varying effects of different types of of breath practices inherent in the yoga tradition and ultimately the role that breathing techniques play in person and public health. Concurrently the script elucidates how different practices alter psycho-physiological states; clarifying why and how they may be employed with specific health populations, how they may enhance and or maintain well-being, and clear guidance regarding precautions and contraindications.

Chapter 3

Cardiorespiratory and Endocrine Mechanisms Behind the Effectiveness of Pranayama

Ramakrishnan Angarai Ganesan

The benefits of pranayama for positive health are well known. Even though there are many studies published on the effectiveness of pranayama, there are very few papers, which actually have systematically studied the physiological mechanisms involved, causing the benefits of pranayama, especially with respect to the cardiac function. This article attempts to have a detailed look at the physiology behind deep breathing. The article also conjectures that voluntary, deep breathing with attention may have a role to play in faster recovery from surgeries, and prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and may be, even cancer. Extended, carefully controlled and detailed studies are needed to prove or disprove these conjectures.

Chapter 4

Neurobiology of Meditation

Danilo Santaella

Meditation should not be considered a simple activity that is performed with focused attention; this is concentration. When practicing concentration correctly, with a good “anchor” for attention, a specific state of mind takes place, in which logic relaxation happens, and there is a relative freedom from self-identification. Such states of mind are to be experienced and cannot be practiced, thus, meditation techniques (concentrations) are the means to reach this goal. Those who achieve such a state experience positive neurophysiological effects, which are being studied for decades, such as increased functionality and connectivity of the brain, and also increased gray matter volume in specific cortical areas, whether in the young, or in the elderly. Meditation has, thus, a proven potential role to help one maintain a healthy cognition and should be included in daily life routines of everybody who wish for it.

Chapter 5

The Neurophilosophy of Meditation

Vinod Deshmukh

Meditation is the art and science of optimal self-integration. We are naturally nested in Nature. Meditation is being at-peace with oneself and at-home in the world. It is the art of self-observation, learning, and developing presence of mind and selfless love. It is a unique mode of being present in the moment. It is a natural state of health and happiness. We should let go of the vicious cycle of negative feelings and discover the virtuous cycle of positive feelings like joy, cheerfulness, equanimity, friendliness, compassion, and love. This is possible through meditative practices like yoga, mindfulness, flow-state and nature-experience. With advancement in neurobiology, we can understand how these meditative skills are learned, developed, evolved, and mastered. These meditative skills and lifestyle are the key to positive psychology and mental health. These secular meditative practices are being recommended in our education and health systems. I have included research on homeostasis, allostasis, circadian rhythms, neural networks, biospheric ecosystem, and nature-experience.

The Yoga of the Bhagavad Gita: Spirituality, Meditation, and the Rise of a New Scientific Paradigm

Rubens Turci

This chapter explores the fact that śraddhā (truth-force or heart force; love-in-action, self-reliance, faith-in-oneself, and also enthusiasm) may be said to represent the key noticeable outcome of spirituality, yoga and meditation, and also that śraddhā can be seen as the main category to bridge the gap between science and spirituality. Being itself the truth-force that is common to scientists (atheists or not) and people of different faiths, śraddhā represents a conceptual category that helps us to explain how science evolves shifting from one paradigm to another.

Molecular Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Yoga

Surabhi Gautam, Rima Dada

Complex chronic lifestyle disorders are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Stress and anxiety associated with today’s hectic life schedule and polluted environment have contributed a lot in triggering and causing many chronic diseases and decreased quality of life, even with pharmacologic treatment. Most of the chronic complex diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, depression, autoimmune diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes mellitus, shared underlying mechanisms like high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, oxidative stress, shorter telomeres, persistent activation of hypothalamo-pituitary adrenal axis, inflammation and dysregulated immune system and thus need to managed by an integrated approach which targets both mind and body. The individuals with these conditions have been reported to benefit from yoga, but the underlying mechanism of action of yoga remains unclear. The aim of this chapter is to summarize the mechanism of action underlying the cumulative effect of yoga on multiple pathways at a cellular level.

Chapter 8

Neurocognitive Mechanisms of Yoga: Implications for Yoga Therapy

Irina Sheftel, Anneke Sips

This chapter combines insights from the neuroscientific research on yoga and meditation with the practical application of yoga therapy. The chapter opens with an overview of neuroscientific concepts related to the practice of yoga and meditation, such as attention, emotional regulation, body awareness, and autonomic regulation. The authors summarise the known effects of yoga and meditation, in relation to these concepts and common mental health disorders. The chapter continues with a case study, a personalised yoga therapy intervention in a client experiencing psychotic symptoms. The intervention is grounded in yoga philosophy, and in the neuroscientific concepts introduced previously. This section is written from the perspective of a yoga therapist and includes practical tips. In the final section, the authors suggest possible directions for future research and implementation of yoga therapy as a complementary treatment in mental healthcare.

Chapter 9

Standards in Yoga Research and Reporting

Steffany Moonaz, Daryl Nault, Atiera Abatemarco

Yoga research is growing rapidly in volume and rigor but varies in sample size, study design, and reporting transparency. Yoga professionals may not be versed in the current research due to a lack of research literacy and may not be well positioned to discern research relevance and quality. Research literacy is necessary to apply research in yoga teaching and therapeutics. Research is part of evidence-informed practice, along with clinical experience and client preferences, and is aligned with concepts from yoga philosophy. Several strategies are available to improve research literacy and evidence-informed practice for yoga professionals, which can help to expand inter-professional collaboration and inform the trajectory of yoga research toward better alignment and application to clinical practice. Yoga research reporting guidelines will improve transparency in research dissemination for application to practice, policy, replication, comparison, and summarization.

Chapter 10

Yoga Therapy: An Overview of Key Research and the Underlying Mechanisms

Eileen Lafer, Margaret McCuiston, Ann Swanson

This chapter reviews the evidence supporting the efficacy of yoga therapy for wellness, and as an adjunct to standard care for a number of chronic conditions. The underlying mechanisms are explored, including the physiological and biochemical changes that have been observed in yoga practitioners. Yoga has been found to activate the relaxation response — a physiological state which reduces stress on bodily systems. Yoga leads to changes in gene expression, including decreases in the expression of genes involved in stress and inflammation. The positive effects of yoga therapy are interpreted through the lens of the biopsychosocial-spiritual model, which cultivates eudaimonic well-being and salutogenesis. Researchers attribute a wide range of yoga’s therapeutic benefits largely to its whole-person approach to well-being.

Chapter 11

The mental health disorders covered in this chapter include: depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, child and adolescent psychiatric disorders, substance use disorders and geriatric psychiatric disorders respectively.

Chapter 12

Yoga as a Healing Modality of Trauma-Related Symptoms and Disorders: From Suffering to Thriving

Elin-Kristin Olsen

Healing after trauma is a long-lasting process involving the body and mind. The neurobiological foundation of trauma calls for more bodily and sensational, bottom-up regulatory approaches. Yoga has been proposed as a possible adjunctive treatment for trauma, and for more complex forms where talk-therapy have been proven insufficient. This chapter will give a theoretical and evidence-based summary of all (to our knowledge) relevant empirical data on yoga as a treatment for trauma-related disorders and symptoms.

Chapter 13

Clinicians Applying Yoga Principles and Practices in Pain Care: An Evidence-Informed Approach

Shelly Prosko, Matthew Taylor

This chapter provides a practical introduction and guidelines for clinicians and researchers to appreciate the relationship between two enormous topics: pain and yoga. The emphasis is on practicality for both audiences with frequent citation to recent related publications and their deeper citations. The intention to fuel the imaginations of both clinicians and researchers occurs with a foundational understanding of how yoga, pain and pain care are related. The authors’ experience in the clinic using yoga for people with pain, and future areas for clinical and research inquiry are included. A list of techniques for the clinic, their clinical rationale, and two case reports ground the material and invite additional reflection for the psychophysiological applications of yoga in pain care.

Chapter 14

Advances in Understanding the Use of Yoga as Therapy in Lymphedema

S. Narahari, Madhur Aggithaya, Terence Ryan

Lymphedema may be caused by dysfunction of the lymphatic system due to damage, block, hypoplasia due to genetic causes or by lymph overload. Lymphatic Filariasis is most prevalent and among the leading causes of disability. This chapter describes the improvements in three yoga protocols of integrative treatment, for lower limb, upper limb and genital lymphedema. There are two sessions of yoga in our treatment protocol. Yoga helps to drain lymph through various mechanisms. Asanas focus on the dermal stretch, joint movement, muscle pumps and muscle stretch and pranayamas on lung expansion. Joint movements and muscle contractions are designed to mimic nodal drainage. The yoga protocol also provides knee strengthening, gait correction, shoulder joint strengthening. Yoga asanas for comorbidities like hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and arthritis and joint surgeries with movement restrictions are customized in the revised protocol. Yoga is an effective treatment in lymphedema and considerably improves the patient’s quality of life.

Chapter 16

Yoga and Weight Management: A Narrative Review

Sachin Sharma, Sushma Pal, Shirley Telles

A comprehensive lifestyle intervention which is effective, yet safe, for weight loss is recommended for weight management. Yoga is one such intervention which includes (i) increased physical activity and (ii) suggestions about healthy eating and other behavioral changes. With this, there have been attempts to assess the effectiveness of yoga for weight management. The present review aimed at (i) evaluating studies assessing the effects of yoga on obesity and (ii) grade them according to standard grading methods. Twenty three studies, of which 9 were RCTs, were included. The rating of RCTs was between 70.6 and 94.2 which can be considered fairly good. However the present review shows that there are fewer studies with (i) adequate sample sizes, (ii) study designs, (iii) long term follow up and (iv) adequate reporting of adverse events to conclude that yoga is an effective and safe intervention for weight loss. Hence further studies with the points described above are required to conclude the safety and efficacy of yoga for weight loss.

Chapter 17

Yoga and Aging: Neurobiological Benefits

Rui Afonso, Danilo Santaella, Elisa Kozasa

Governments and societies need to be prepared to confront population aging. Such preparation includes policies that can improve quality of life, functional capacity, and health of the general population, encouraging a more active and healthier lifestyle. Normal aging is associated with changes in brain structure and function, which may cause behavioral and cognitive impairments. It is important to understand which changes make some individuals healthier than others. Yoga has been associated with improved quality of life, cognition and physical health as well as brain functional and structural changes.

Special Yoga for Children and Young People With Special Needs

Jyoti Manuel

Special Yoga has been a provider of therapeutic yoga practices and training since its inception. The non-profit organization started with a yoga center in London, UK. The Special Yoga London center offered a therapeutic and nourishing, nurturing space for families of children with special needs who were welcomed with love, compassion and totally non judgmentally with open arms. The work spread globally through the London based trainings and the therapeutic yoga that was offered to children at the center and within education. This chapter will discuss my experience and understanding of the efficacy of yoga for children and young people, specifically those with cerebral palsy and autism and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). I will share some of the practices, benefits and case studies of two separate research studies that were undertaken by Special Yoga for each population. I will also share other case histories of children that we have worked with.

Yoga as an Intervention for Students With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

Pauline Jensen

Research conducted in both the field of yoga and the field of behavioural disorders in children and adolescents leads to the speculation that the benefits of yoga practice demonstrated with respect to physiological, psychological, emotional and psychosocial functioning may be applicable to the impairments evidenced in these areas in behavioural disorders. The intervention – 20 weekly one-hour sessions of yoga - required a large commitment for the participants, their families and the yoga instructor. The results suggested that yoga appears to exert its impact on stabilising the emotions (a secondary symptom) and reducing oppositional behaviour, frequently co-morbid (40 percent) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Given the limitations of this study, the results do indicate some significant changes in the behaviour of some of the boys with ADHD. In conclusion yoga shows promise as a non-invasive, inexpensive, adjuvant treatment for boys with ADHD.

Chapter 21

Yoga: A Multi-Dimensional Therapeutic Approach to Autism Spectrum Disorder

Kankan Gulati, Praerna Bhargav, Shalu Abraham, Hemant Bhargav

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental disorder manifests as impairment in social communication an interaction with restrictive & repetitive patterns of behaviour. Yoga therapy, a mind-body intervention, employs a multi-dimensional approach to reduce psychological distress & bring balance and harmony at the levels of body, breath & mind through physical postures, breathing practices, chanting and relaxation techniques respectively, thus enhancing overall well-being. Various yoga studies have shown promise in improving symptoms of ASD by improvement in sensory processing, gross motor skills, balance and coordination, cognition, imitation skills and the ability to connect in relationships. This chapter aims to provide an overview of the potential role of Yoga therapy in the management of ASDs with emphasis on future standardized yoga trials with robust methodology and long-term follow-ups to establish the clinical utility of Yoga therapy for the same. Also, a tentative yoga lifestyle module for ASD with necessary contra-indications and practical tips has been provided.

Chapter 22

Yoga and Polyvagal Theory: Effects and Applications for Well-Being

Marlysa Sullivan

This chapter explores yoga as a salutogenic intervention supportive of eudaimonic well-being with its wide-spread health effects for various patient populations. Autonomic nervous system regulation and resilience are considered as important meditators for the promotion of biopsychosocial health. Polyvagal theory offers a novel perspective on how underlying neural platforms support combined physiological, psychological, and behavioral states—inclusive of eudaimonic well-being. This chapter describes the convergence of neurophysiological ideas of neuroception, interoception, and neural platforms with yoga foundational concepts such as discriminative wisdom and the gunas. This translatory language of eudaimonic well-being and polyvagal theory offers a framework for yoga to be understood and integrated into current healthcare and research contexts while maintaining its unique perspective and foundational wisdom.

Chapter 23

Traditional Frameworks of Well-Being and Modern Science

Ganesh Mohan

This chapter describes how to connect traditional frameworks from yoga to modern science and systems theory in a way that is evidence-based, clinically testable, inclusive, and extensible. This way of systematization enables leveraging the evidence for yoga from across the spectrum of well-being modalities.The key in our presentation is the choice of an approach that is equally valid for both ancient and modern systems. We begin by examining the importance of a skill-based approach and layout how well-being systems can be built by mapping the skills and qualities of the organism. We take a selection of domains or categories under which skills from traditional and modern sources can be analyzed: attention, transcendence, movement, breathing, devotion, cognition, and emotion.We conclude the chapter by presenting a larger map of well-being that includes more domains arranged from a clinical perspective.

Chapter 24

The Science and Art of Contemporary Breathwork and Yoga

Jim Morningstar, jessica dibb

This chapter provides evidence for the benefit of bringing yoga and its breathing practices into a working relationship with contemporary breathwork techniques for the betterment of both in certain circumstances. The history and developmental overlap of both are explored as well as their applications in the field of physical heath, psychotherapy and spiritual growth. The benefits of both faster than normal and slower than normal breathing techniques are reviewed for the treatment of anxiety, depression and addictions as well as the neurological correlates for breathwork and trauma recovery. A pilot study utilizing the combination of the two disciplines is reported.

Chapter 25

An Exploration of Influence of Duration on Physiological Effects of Asanas

Debadutta Subudhi, M. Manivannan

Different body postures that can be maintained for a certain duration with awareness are called yoga-asanas. These asanas matter flexibility, coordination, and strength, while the breathing practices and meditation sharpens the mind for better awareness and reduce anxiety and thus adds quality into life. Other beneficial effects might involve a reduction of stress, blood pressure, and improvements in resilience, mood, and metabolic regulation. The asanas performed regularly for a short duration in hours is well studied in the literature. However, when performed for a long duration continuously for several hours (40-hour yogathon), without food and sleep has a significant effect in regulating homeostasis. The homeostasis is accessed through cardio-respiratory and galvanic skin response changes. The study shows the physiological changes after the yogathon and compares it with effects on physiology due to short term yoga. It also emphasizes on the reduction of dependency on food, because of energy compensation through yoga-asanas.
