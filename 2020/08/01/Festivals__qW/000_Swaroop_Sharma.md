Namaste,

  

Can venerated scholars enlighten me on these things?

  

1\. Were festivals like we celebrate them today across different मासs also in vogue during Dwāpara & Tretā? For instance, was Rāmanavami celebrated during Dwāpara? Similarly, what about Nāgapanchami, Jyotirbhīmeśvara-vrata etc.

  

2\. If months like Śrāvaņa, Bhādrapada Etc are auspicious to us, they should have been equally auspicious to the people of previous Yugas. So, is there evidence & reference to understand the auspicious-nessof the festivals & certain Māsas?

  

3\. Is there any book which can guide us through the evolution of Festivals, their relevance in the context of auspicious Māsas?
