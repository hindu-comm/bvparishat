Shri Swaroop Shamraji,  
Jai Shri Ram!

\< 1. Were festivals like we celebrate them today across different मासs also in vogue during Dwāpara & Tretā? For instance, was Rāmanavami celebrated during Dwāpara? Similarly, what about Nāgapanchami, Jyotirbhīmeśvara-vrata etc.>

There is a lot of confusion about the duration of yugas, as to whether each Yuga, including Kaliyuga, has a span of 1080000 years (as per Aryabhatiya) or whether they are in the ratio of 1:2:3:4 i.e., Kaliyuga 432000 years, Dwapara Yuga 864000 years, Treta Yuga 1296000 years and Krita Yuga 172800 years as per the Surya Siddhanta. The total duration of all the four yugas in both the cases is 4320000 years.

The Puranas also seem to be agreeing with the Surya Siddhanta duration of the yugas.

Thus unless this issue is resolved as to when Tretayuga ended and Dwapara Yuga started and so on, it is impossible to say with any confidence as to whether festivals like Shri Rama Navmi etc. were celebrated in Dwapara Yuga also.

\< 2. If months like Śrāvaņa, Bhādrapada Etc are auspicious to us, they should have been equally auspicious to the people of previous Yugas. So, is there evidence & reference to understand the auspicious-nessof the festivals & certain Māsas?>

The entire Vedic lore including the Panchama-Veda viz. the Puranas and the two epics talk of seasonal months---and years----and I repeat nothing but seasonal months and years----whether solar or lunar, the latter getting subsumed in solar seasonal months via adhika-masa etc.!
And as even a student of Primary SchoolGeography books knows, seasons are impervious to the effects of precession! But somehow, the Vedic seasonal months got "amalgamated" with (niraadhaar) nirayana---**-under the pretext of precession!-**--- and there too with quite a fictitious Ayanamsha "invented" by late N C Lahiri, which is euphemistically known as "Chitra Ayanamsha"---because in 285 AD, the (mean!) Vernal Equinox was opposite the Star Chitra!

It is used by IAE (Rashtriya Panchanga). They too do not call such Ayanamsha "tonsured" longitudes as sidereal, (because they are not!) but nirayana!

This will be clear from the attachment IAE-nirayana! And why the IAE is using niraadhar nirayana? Because the Govt. of India advised so! And why did theGOI advise so? Because the CRC had advised so! And why
the CRC advise so? Because they did not want to disturbthe old apple-pie order of Grahalaaghava/Makaranda etc., as was being followed by late N C Lahiri, who was the Secretary of the Calendar Reform Committee!

This pathetic situation can be set right only by either some revolutionary individual efforts or evolutionary general progression!
No need to indicate here that the latter procedure may take at least a couple of centuries if not more!

And till then, we must then continue to celebrate all the festivals and muhurtas on wrong days!

\< 3. Is there any book which can guide us through the evolution of Festivals, their relevance in the context of auspicious Māsas?>  

Hemadri, Dharmasindhu, Niranaya Sindhu etc. books throw a flood of light on all the festivals but very often they create more confusion than resolve the same by clubbing Sayana with nirayana at several places!

The "Report of the Calendar Reform Committee" has given criteria for all the important festivals on pages 101 to 116. So has the "Indian Ephemeris" A.D 1800 to 2000 by Swami Kannu Pillai, in its introductory portion.

Both these works are available for download.

Quite a few festivals like Shri Rama Navmi, Dipavali, Shri Krishna Janmashtami etc. are being celebrated as per the tradition, since I have not been able to find any references to the same in any of the Puranas or the Mahabharata or the Valmiki Ramayana etc. It is also possible I have overlooked some of them, and maybe the other respected members of this august forum can throw some light on the same.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
