Congratulations Sri Megh Kalyanasundaram for showing that Yaska was the first one to show that the Moon reflects Sunlight and not Anaxagoras.

  

Your view on Nirukta text 'उपदेशाय ग्लायन्तोऽवरे बिल्मग्रहणायेमं ग्रन्थं समाम्नासिषुः। वेदं च वेदाङ्गानि च। as showing that the 'act of compiling' is the other of 'oral communication'. The interpretation that I was taught, is that compilation refers to the division of Vedas and development of certain concepts explicitly in Vedangas. Interesting, nevertheless, that you see it as related to writing, or at least the 'other' of oral transmission.

  

Regards

Senani
