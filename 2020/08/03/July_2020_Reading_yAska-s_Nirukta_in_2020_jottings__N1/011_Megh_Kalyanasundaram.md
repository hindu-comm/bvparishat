Namaste,

  

This thread contained a paper (and here is its [successor](https://www.academia.edu/44767596/A_case_for_a_place_for_Y%C4%81ska_s_Nirukta_in_inclusive_global_histories_of_Technology_Science_Gender_Equality_in_Inheritance_and_an_argument_of_consequence_to_the_chronology_of_some_Sm%E1%B9%9Bti_texts)) which engaged with, amongst other things, some literature (over the years) concerned with the chronological epoch of Yāska's *Nirukta*. Included below is a paper subsequent to both above, and more importantly, the most recent—"Published online by Cambridge University Press: 10 December 2020"\[1\]—example (at least amongst what I could find) where the chronological epoch appears (some may say) 'altered'.

Best,

PS: It is not my intention to reduce this paper just the portion highlighted. For example, I have read some of Dr. Visigalli's otherpapers and it has been mostly time well-spent.

At the same time, I am flagging this facet, for anyone else who may be interested in this facet too, amongst other (some may say higher-order) things.
