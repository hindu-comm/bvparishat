Dear Megha

  

I have gone through your Paper .

  

It is clear from the references that you have touched all Papers / Articles that are related to the subject .

  

Following the Paninisutram- yaskadibhyo gotre 2-4-63 - it is established by traditional scholars that Yaskamaharshi preceded Panini .

  

In Indian tradition the uninterruptedtradition of Guru and Sishya is considered as the highest Pramanam (authority) in all matters . Such a tradition also suggests that Panini came after Yaska .

As far as the letter ळ is concerned it is listed in Paniniyasikshaby the name दुःस्पृष्ट ।

It is not there in Ashtadhyayi because Panini did not need the same in his scheme of Grammatical Applications .

Since Patanjali , in Paspasahnikam clearly says that Panini was aware of all the 1130 branches of Veda , one need not discuss as to whether was

familiar with a particular Vedasakha or not .

Sages , like Patanjali , do not and need not twist things as they do not expect anything in return and we cannot compare the present day Scholars with the sages .

Congratulations for this beautiful and usefulPaper .
