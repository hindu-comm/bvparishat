Kushagra Ji,

The video you have mentioned above reminded me of the recent Malayalam movie called 'Trance' (for info about this movie see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trance_(2020_film)> or [www.imdb.com/title/tt6720802/](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt6720802/)), in which the protagonist Viju Prasad, a motivational speaker, is hired to be the face of a religious scam for which he undergoes rigorous training. As his popularity grows, he sinks into the depths of darkness and delusion.

Regards

P V S Kumar
