From the five Mahakavyas, two episodes from each, were presented in this format at KSU every week. I had the good fortune of attending them. For each of the ten programs expert singers and exponents were commissioned. Everyone of them did a splendid job. We could know, for our wonderment, that such talented persons are there in Karnataka. Some of the performers were very young. I distinctly remember one Dr. Keyur Karagudari, a young scholar from Dharwad who presented his vyakhyana of a kavya, for the entire length of which he did not require the printed text; the whole thing was in his memory. He even presented a comparative text rendering, from another kavya, again without needing a written text. 

  

I shall give the link for the entire playlist of this memorable event in another post.
