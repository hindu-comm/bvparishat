Come to think of it, it's there in Hindi too. For example, a term like 'maarampitti' (मारमपिट्टी) a kid's game where whoever has the ball tries to really throw it hard on a fleeing kid. The idea is to really get him hard on his back. It seems to be a combination of मारना and पिटना . I am sure somebody else can analyze it better. Another example is the multiplication table, दो एकम दो,  

' two ones are two'.  

  

There are other instances of this type in Hindi - I cant recall right now.
