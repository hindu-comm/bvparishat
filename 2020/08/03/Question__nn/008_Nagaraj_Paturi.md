I think Annamaachaarya and Krishnamaachaarya belong to two different categories of namings.

  

While Krishnamaachaarya belongs to the issue of aagama of 'm' being discussed here, in the case of Annamaachaarya it can be said that m is organically part of the word annam itself.

  

It is tempting to guess that the 'm' in the other names is a product of analogy to names like Annamaachaarya.

  

But the data doesn't encourage such a guess.

  

We have names like Krishnam Raju, Pullam Raju etc. among the Rajus and Bhatrajus among Telugu people.

  

We have names like Allama Prabhu in Kannada.

  

Father of Vishvanatha Nayaka , the founder of the Tanjore Nayaka dynasty is Nagama Nayaka (Naagama Naayaka)

  

One possibility is this 'm' being the shortened version of 'ma' of such names.

  

Naagamma Naayaka \> Naagama Naayaka

  

Allamma Prabhu \> Allama Prabhu

  

But we do not have the shortened 'm' versions of these names. i.e., we do not have Naagamnaayaka , Allamprabhu.

  

That is discouraging for the path mma \> ma \> m

  

But Krishnamma Aachaarya \> Krishnama Aachaarya \> Krishnamaachaarya, Krishnamma Raju \> Krishnama Raju \> Krishnam Raju, Pullamma Raju \> Pullama Raju \> Pullam Raju is possible.

  

Similarly Baalamma Bhat \> Baalama Bhat \> Baalam Bhat is also possible.

  

In any case, in Telugu this feature of Bhattu preceded this 'm' is very much frequent.

  

There are names like Taatam Bhattu, changing into Taatamb(h)otlu , Midatamb(h)otlu etc.

  

Changing names into 'm' ending versions is colloquial nick naming or affectionate calling name style in coastal Andhra.

  

Rama Rao , Ramachandra Rao etc. frequently change into Raaamam in the calling form.

  

Kameshwara Rao becomes Kaamesham

  

Sundar Rao, Sundareshwara Rao etc. change into Sundaram

  

Even women names like Ratna change into Ratnam.

  

But whether the aagama of 'm' being discussed has got to do with these ending 'm's or not is clear. These names could as well be the non-human (amahat) singular noun ending native Telugu suffix 'm' \< 'mu' ( \< mmu \< mbu \< \* mp(u) (Proto - Dravidian)) also.

  

There is elongation of 'a' too preceding Bhatt .

  

There are names like Rangaa Bhatt(l)(u), Tippaa Bhatt(l)(u) in Telugu speaking areas.
