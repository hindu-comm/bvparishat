Dear Vishvas Ji,

  

  You are right to raise this question. I only have an indirect answer to this question. The Padapāṭha of the R̥gveda as I see from the edition of the Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala, Pune, does not give any clue if the pādas were treated separately. However, beginning with the Kramapāṭha, the half-verses \[ardharca\] are treated as units, and the end of the half-verse \[ardharca\] is marked with a repetition of the last word like X iti X. So, at least the Kramapāṭha clearly treats pādas 1-2, and pādas 3-4, as contiguous units. I am assuming that the Kramapāṭha is based on the Padapāṭha. However, I should revise my statement that if each pāda were originally independent, as syntactically needed for the use of enclitics like मे and ते, that stage is at least older than the Kramapāṭha, if not Padapāṭha. I admit all this is highly speculative, but there is an interesting issue of apparent dissonance between the behavior of sandhis in the known Saṃhitā and the syntactic requirements of the enclitics. I hope this is now a clearer statement of the question. With best regards,
