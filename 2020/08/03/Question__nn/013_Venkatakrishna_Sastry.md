Namaste



I share the following information.



1. On \< whether forms likeते and मे do occur at the beginning of pādas 2 and 4 in known Vedic or post-Vedic literature.> Traditional Rudra prashna anuvaka's seem to have illustrations for this. Whether they are debated or other wise, I do not know.

Rudra prashna -sasvara document: <https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_veda/rudra.pdf>

Rudra prashna- Cha-me document:
<https://shaivam.org/veda/shri-rudra-chamaka-mandra> 



Should these passages be taken as ' poetic' ? the views differ. If it is to go by rendering, they are poetic and structured to set pattern.

Does Paninian rule apply to all the illustrations in this /similar vedic passage ? Views differ. I am of the opinion' No, Paninian rule does not extend uniformly in veda'.



2. The reading I have heard is \< अपदादौ \> , which makes the interpretation : 'at the beginning of the 'word'. May be readings differ.



Regards
