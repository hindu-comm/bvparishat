That is interesting. In Marathi, there is a pattern of adding अम् to pseudo-Sanskrit formations. For example, there is a comic drama titled: वयं मोठं खोटं, something about false \[खोटे\] age \[वय\]. Similarly, delaying in doing something is called अळंटळं करणे, which perhaps refers to doing some meaningless chanting. An engineer friend of mine was acting as a priest at some Pooja in Detroit, and though he had the printed text in his hand, he was randomly adding अम्, or अ: to various words: अस्तु:/अस्तुम्, फल:/फलम् etc. After the ceremony was over, I asked him why he was doing this. His answer was that he was adding what was missing in the printed text to correct it.
