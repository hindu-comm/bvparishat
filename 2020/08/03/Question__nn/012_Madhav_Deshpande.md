I am puzzled by a curious feature of Sanskrit versification, syntax and sandhis. While sandhis are supposed to take place between pādas 1 and 2, and between 3 and 4, the enclitic forms such as ते and मे, as they come under the Pāṇinian restriction of अपादादौ cannot occur at the beginning of any pādas. I am looking for any serious discussion or research on these features, and whether forms likeते and मे do occur at the beginning of pādas 2 and 4 in known Vedic or post-Vedic literature.
I will appreciate any help you canprovide. With best wishes,
