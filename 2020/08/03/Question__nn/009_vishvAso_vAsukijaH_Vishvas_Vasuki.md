Atleast as far as kRShNamAchArya is concerned, it being a mostly tamil shrIvaiShNava name, the mahAchArya -> mAchArya is fits the pattern far better. For example, one of the stalwarts of shrIvaiShNavas is called manavALa-mAmuni (from mahAmuni). It is a matter of elision of ha rather than addition of ma. Very common in colloquial tamil. Or for that matter sinhala (mAlinga from mahAlinga) or even kannada (mAdegauDa from mahadeva gauDa).

  

The rest of the quoted examples seem to follow a different route. Many north Indians these days are named shivam (including an acquaintance in ujjain). This addition of m seems more stylish than etymological - like the current (but previously absent) fashion of elision of a in south India (example I am named vishvAs rather than vishvAsa).
