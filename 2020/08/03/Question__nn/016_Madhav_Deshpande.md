Dear Dr. Bhat,

  

  This is the rule I cited in my question. What I noticed is that the Saṃhitāpāṭha connects the end of the first pāda with the beginning of the second, and the same holds between pādas 3 and 4. However, when it comes to the behaviors directed by the rule P. 8/1/18, each pāda seems to be independent units. This dissonance between unity for sandhi, but independence of pādas for other matters directed by P. 8/1/18 needs an explanation. One possibility that comes to my mind is that at some very early stage, each pāda was also recited independently without connecting it with sandhis with other pādas. This would establish full independence of each pāda. However, such a stage would have to be prior to the Padapāṭhas that have come down to us, and we have no sure way of reaching that prior stage of the Saṃhitās.
