It is interesting to note that lots of Rk-s preserved in other vaidika texts, such as naxatra sUkta from TB (<https://archive.org/stream/Anandashram_Samskrita_Granthavali_Anandashram_Sanskrit_Series/ASS_037_Taittiriya_Brahmanam_with_Sayanabhashya_Part_2_-_Narayanasastri_Godbole_1898#page/n249/mode/2up>) are indeed split pAda-wise. This can still be heard in current recitations. Ditto in case of sAma reciters (at least the one tradition I've heard) chanting Rks such as "꣡क्र꣢न्दय कु꣣रु꣡ घोष꣢꣯म् म꣣हा꣢न्तम्... "
(<https://archive.org/details/SamaVedaSanhitaWithSayanabhashyaVolume2SatyavrataSamasrami1876bis_201804/page/n443/mode/2up>). They were probably received at a similar time.
