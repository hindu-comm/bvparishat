It is easily explainable from Tamil grammar. But I dont know if it's relevant. It probably might be if there are parallel processes in Kannada or Telugu.

  

In Tamil grammar, from the point of view of stem suffix analysis, there are a category of sounds or particles which attach themselves between 'pakuti' (\< prakRti or the nominal stem or verbal root) and the vikuti (\< vikRti or the nominal or verbal terminations) much like vikarana or agama. These are called iTainilai (intermediaries, literally 'madhyastha'). These iTainilai themselves are categorized into many, one of which is called 'caariyai' . The 'caariyai' gets in when the vikuti (vikRti) attaches itself to that which is to the left of it. It can also get in when a 'patappuNarcci' (pada sandhi ) is involved. There are other places where it can get in too. They usually have a 'inna piRavum' (elsewhere or other occurrences too, somewhat like anyEshvapi dRshyate) type door open.  

  

'caariyai' literally means 'dependent particle'. There are many types of caariyai, one of which is called 'am' caariyai.  

  

Example:

  

puLi (tamarind) + kAy (unripe fruit) ---> puLiyagkAy which is analyzed as puLi y am kAy where 'y' is the intervocalic glide ('uTampaTumey') and 'am' is the caariyai.

  

the meaning is unripe fruit of the tamarind.

  

Similarly puLi + pazam (ripe fruit) ---> puLiyampazam (same analysis)

  

It's a very productive process.  

  

In classical times, it was a very productive process for personal names too.  

  

Example.

  

kaNNan s/o kantan was called kaNNaGkantan analyzed as kaNNan am kantan, the terminal 'an' (a PNG indicator) is deleted in the sandhi process by a specific action.

Likewise pUtan s/o cEntan is called cEntampUtan. The analysis is likewise.

  

These are names of poets in the 'kuRuntokai' anthology.  

  

  

  

Hope this helps,
