Mahamahopadhyaya Patrakarshiromani Kalasaraswati Dr. Tirumala Ramachandragaru was an editor, author, journalist, freedom fighter, and linguist. He was fluent in his mother tongue Telugu as well as other languages including Kannada, Tamil, Sanskrit and Prakrit. Dr. Ramachandra, who had various professions and gained various experiences, was a humble linguist who broadly described himself as a "bhashasevaka". He has authored over 80 books. He most importantly wrote on linguistics. Among the many titles he received were the (then) Andhra Pradesh Sahitya Akademi award and the Kendriya Sahitya Akademi award. **The Telugu Department of IIT-Benares Hindu University will host an International Webinar on the works of Dr. Tirumala Ramchandra from August 5 to 8.** Language enthusiasts are urged to participate and make this event a success.
