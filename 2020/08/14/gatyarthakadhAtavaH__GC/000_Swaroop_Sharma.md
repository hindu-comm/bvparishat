Namaste,

Respected Scholars,

  

There are many धातुs with गत्यर्थः। गतिः based on ancient available usages are of different kinds. May it be walking, running, jumping, falling or flyingगतिः is used as if a blanket word!

  

However, there are many otherगत्यर्थकधातवः which aren't in vogue at all.

  

Can a language as systematic as Samskritam, really have so many "irrelevant looking"गत्यर्थकधातवः?Shouldn't there be a reason behind so manyधातुswith गत्यर्थः?

  

What could be the reason behind?

Has there been any research on the same?
