To see all the derived words (that are listed in Apte's dictionary), you may use the Concordance of Dhaatuvrttis available in Samsaadhanii - a Sanskrit Computational Toolkit available at <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl> and at <https://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl>

  

For example, the words derived from भू are shown here:<https://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/dhaatupaatha/graphs/BU1.svg>
