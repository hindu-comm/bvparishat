Namaste

  

Regarding point no 1, the बृहद्धातुकुसुमावलिः of TR Krishnamacharya (<https://archive.org/details/Brihad_Dhatu_Rupavali_TR_Krishnamacharya/page/n43/mode/2up>) contains the same, along with verbal forms.

  

Regarding point no 2, it seems to be a reversal of Aindravyaakarana. Let me explain. It is said that when Brihaspati was teaching grammarto Indra, he taught all the proper finished forms of words, like रामः रामौ रामाः ...., देवः देवौ देवाः, ....शिवः शिवौशिवाः ... and so on. Indra was a very good student and learnt everything when told only once. A thousand years passed in that fashion, with Brihaspati teaching and Indra learning, but the words being not yet exhausted. Once Indra realized that this can go on endlessly, he formulated grammar based on productive rules. Thus by creating one artificial pratyaya सुप् and learning how sup works, all forms such as रामः, देवः, शिवः can be learnt. Thus were pratyayas formulated.

Senani
