The book by T R Krishnamacharya is BrihaddhaaturoopavaliH. Not kusumaavali. BrihaddhaatukusumaakaraH is a contemporary one-volume work on Dhatus giving only the verbal forms (<https://www.amazon.in/BRIHAD-DHATU-KUSUMAKAR-PT-HAREKANT-MISHRA/dp/B076V7X3SF>). This is a veryhandy reference work for Sanskrit students, since out of the around 2,000 dhatus less than 500 are commonlyused in literature. Good knowledge of even 300 dhatus makes one's vocabulary very rich. For the rest, a reference work such as this would be handy.
