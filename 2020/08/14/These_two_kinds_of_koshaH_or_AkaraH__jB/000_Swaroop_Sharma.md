Namaste,

  

I'm in search of a dictionary or a collection with these two features -

  

1\. Words within a कोशः or आकरः listed as per the धातुः, for instance all words derived out of गमलृ गतौ at one place. These words should be inclusive of उपसर्गः to the same.

  

2\. Wordswithin a कोशः or आकरःenlisted as per प्रत्ययः, for instance all words under अच्/शतृ at one place.

  

Is it even possible to create one such (as mentioned in point 2) if not existing currently?**I've one naive thought**, which I feel is in an advantage, in the context of second point -

  

Everyप्रत्ययः will by default come with a meaning/s. By listing all words of a particularप्रत्ययः at one place, doesn't it become easy even for a beginner to learn Samskritam? For example, in case of स्वार्थे क-प्रत्ययः,क at the end of the word doesn't make a huge difference. The word meaning before or afterक-प्रत्ययः, remains the same (hoping my understanding regardingक-प्रत्ययःis right) Hence, the reader understands its true meaning. So, mentioning aप्रत्ययः, its अर्थः/s & all of its words under the same can help us understand the correct meaning of the same, without causing much misinterpretation.

  

Hope to be making sense :-X
