Respected Scholars,

Namaste !  
  
I am glad to announce the new publication of my book:- अभिज्ञानशकुन्तला नाटकस्य पञ्चरङ्गावृत्तयः ।। The book contains 42 Acts of the drama !It is published by the Central Sanskrit University, Delhi, in August, 2020.  
  
(1) One may find here the basic (=Act 1 to 7 ) texts of all five ( the Kashmiri, Maithili, Bengali, Dakshinatya and Devnagari ) recensions of the drama.  
  
(2) For the first time I have ventured to give a reconstructed text of the full drama, ( with required arguments in Sanskrit , in footnotes ) which is prepared after thorough investigation of all available variants, interpolations & abridgement in traditional manuscripts.  
  
(3) One can find a detailed comparative study of the texts of all five recensions of the drama.  
  
(4) After examining / locating the real cause of creating voluminous variants & interpolations, I have concluded that all five ( so-called) recensions are nothing but " Stage Versions of the Drama " ! So the title of the book is - पञ्चरङ्गावृत्तयः ।।  
(5) At the end of the volume, there are various (six) appendices of unique importance.  
  
Hope that the scholarly world will give the critical comments on the same after the reading.  
  
Regards,
