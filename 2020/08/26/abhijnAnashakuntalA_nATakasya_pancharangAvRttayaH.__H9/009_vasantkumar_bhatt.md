Respected Dr. Nagaraj Ji,  
  
Namaste !  
  
1) first of all I should thank all of you, Prof. Ashoka Aklujkar ji, Prof. M. Deshpande ji, Prof Saroja ji, Prof Siddhartha Ji, Prof Bandopadhyaya ji, Prof Mahulikar Madam, Prof Mamata Das, Dr. VikramJoshi...., for their kind words of appreciation.  
  
2) ever since the first publication of the drama ( Sir William Jones, 1789 CE ) , nobody has tried to look at hundreds of available manuscripts of this drama. Most of the editors has consulted ONLY 10 to 15/ 25 manuscripts and prepared their (so-called) "critical editions " of different different regional versions ! & declared them as "Recension ".( I am sorry to say that "The editing" of of the Abhijnana-shakuntalam went in wrong direction during last 230 years ! ) . It means- (A) nobody has consultedeach different regional versions at a time ! ( B) no body has furnished any detailed / all round comparative study till the day, so far as I know. (3) Nobody knows that there are some manuscripts which contains a Longer Devnagari version & it is very similar with the Kashmiri Sharada text.  
So I put my efforts in this direction & still working.... Om !  
Hope the new generation will look into the problem.  
Regards and thanks again ,
