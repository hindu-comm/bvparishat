Namaste,

  

The English translation of certain Samskritam words appear scary on [spokensanskrit.com](http://spokensanskrit.com). But, owing to the fact, that I don't know Samskritam in entirety, I can't allege anything against this dictionary based.

  

Therefore, I'm seeking the help of scholars here to know how reliable this online dictionary is?

  

I've attached a file that translates वर्तते। From where did these many meaningscome from?
