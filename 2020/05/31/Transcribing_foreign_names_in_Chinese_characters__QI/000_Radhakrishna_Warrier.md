Today my son showed me through WhatsApp video my three-and-a-half-year-old grandson trying to read a story book. He learnt the English alphabet quite some ago. My son taught him the phonetic values of the letters through interesting videos. But there were many times when the little guy came across a new word, his attempts to decipher the pronunciation of the word wouldn’t work. The rules that he learned through the videos would fail there. Then the correct pronunciation had to be told to him. This set me thinking about the one to one correspondence between the written character and its pronunciation in various languages of the world. No doubt Indian languages beat other languages hands down in this aspect.   



This also reminded me of my attempt at getting my name written in Chinese years ago while I was living in Canada. When it comes to Chinese, the question of correspondence does not arise at all between the written character and the pronunciation of the word.  Chinese characters are logograms that represent an idea, or the meaning of a word, rather than how the word sounds. This enables the same written word to work for different Chinese languages like Mandarin, Shanghainese, Hakka, and so on. The word is pronounced differently in these different languages, but the meaning conveyed by the logogram remains the same. However, this makes transcription of foreign names very difficult in Chinese. Of the many techniques to do the transcription, two are frequently used. One is to find similar sounding Mandarin words for the syllables of the foreign words. The second is to translate the word, if possible, to Chinese and then use the logogram for the translated word.



It was on a Chinese New Year day that I thought of getting my name transcribed in Chinese.  For this, I sought the help of a Chinese friend and colleague. He sat thinking for a while and then said “It is very hard to choose appropriate Chinese characters to transcribe the sounds of your long name. To make matters worse, my choice of characters might be read differently by another person. The best course of action is to translate the name and then write it in Chinese. What does your name mean?” 



That question, the meaning of my name, set me also thinking for a while. I told him that Hindus worship Lord Krishna as a human incarnation of god and Radha was his teenage sweetheart. My name is a combination of Radha and Krishna. “What does the name Krishna mean?” he asked again. I told him that it meant “black” in Sanskrit.  Lord Krishna is supposed to have been a dark-skinned person.  “What does Radha mean?” was his third question. I don’t know the exact meaning of Radha. But I know that Radha is supposed to have been very fair.  I told him that Krishna’s sweetheart Radha was a very fair girl.  My friend again sat thinking for a while and then in several beautiful calligraphic strokes transcribed “Radhakrishna” into Chinese. 



Time frolicked in gay abandon. I was now in another city in Canada and worked for another company.  By coincidence, it was another Chinese New Year day.  I showed to my new Chinese friend the old piece of paper on which my name was written and told him it was my name in Chinese.  He looked at the paper, frowned and said ‘No, it is not your name in Chinese.” “What is it then?” I asked him.  He said, “what is written here is BLACK AND WHITE.” 



So, that is my sweet name in Chinese 🙂 .
