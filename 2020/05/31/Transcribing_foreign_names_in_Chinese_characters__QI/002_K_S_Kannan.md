I am reminded of what I was told really happened

when English used to be taught by the translation method.

  

The teacher asked (in Tamil) the name of the student.

The student said Suryakanthi.

Asked to say the same in English,

the kid said: My name is Sunlight.

  

If we translate even Proper Nouns,

we will have to say that the *Bhagavad Gita* is a dialogue between

Mr. Black and Mr. White (Krishna and Arjuna).
