Namaste Marcis Gasuns



On your observations : \[ \< I'm kindly asking anyone interested in Sanskrit lexicography to give as a helping hand. \> and \< and what was the answer 5 years ago ? > \] The question brooks a detailed answer.



**Upfront Note**: My response observations are only meant to
point out the seriousness of work pending to be done, the lack of attention and resources, lack of priority and clarity of vision, AND
the fall out consequence of not doing this work, at least now ! 

My utmost respect continues for all the scholars who have engaged with Samskruth tradition studies, in one way or other, in the past and
present. Samskrutham as a language has been used by Charvaka as well as Vednatin, Sanatana Dharma discourse providers in vedic and a-vaidic streams. The ' thought - Opinion differenceshas not changed their
acknowledging the Samskruth Langauge Standards set in Paninian
Muni-Traya Tradition. The Colonial pedagogy has distrubed this 'Langauge -pedagogy' deeply and distrubingly. The hermeneutic error part of this has been pushed below the carpet. There is no place for personal animosity or comment in pointing this . I am subject to correction. I do recognize the value and importance of work done by several schoalrs of west, due to which only we have current access to resoruces and carry on this debate.





1. **The answer that was made five years ago or even earlier by traditional schools was a pointer to the methodology adpated by then lexicographers and translators of Samskruth works. **

**That answer has not changed. The corrections remain unaddressed. **

**Dr. Yadu Moharir has made many pointed questions on this
forum for this issue, using the concept of 'Viniyoga' of samskruth terms in this regard.**



To say little more clearly, the **' lexia' approach** of 16th century liturgical scholarship from 'Religion' frame used for ' Latin-Greek-Roman' langauge and Church supported ' spread of Gods words' are the mother seeds / poison pills present in several currently popular , post colonial Sanskrit-english ' **DICTIONARIES**'. These works have not met the true definition and standards set for what ' **LEXIA**' stands for in original 'LATIN-GREEK-ROMAN' languages. Nor do they meet the traditional standards set under **'Vedanga Shaastra- Kosha- Nirukti framework for padartha, vakyaartha, taatparya-nirnaya**'. The tools are helpful, but SERIOUSLY FALL SHORT BY INHERENT HERMENEUTIC ERRORS OF METHODOLOGY AND MOTIVES .

Therefore, the ' Current Dictionaries need a Revist and Revision to bring them to a level to meet the ' necessary and sufficiency expectancies of Samskruth langauge standards by Teaching- learning-using- research-translation. It is a mammoth task, agreed. But the consequences of not doing this even after two centuries after having clear knowledge of the defects is suicidal. Much worse is accelerating the spread of disinformation masquerading as ' authentic tradition'.



The 16th century ' LEXIA' approach, got modified and adapted in later half of 19th century by technology-facilitation of ' Annotated- Hyper Text Protocol' approach. The acceleration and elevation of 'Print media social outreach' through ' electronic publication, and WEB media
information access and dissemination', the electronic repositories , the OCR challenges, the ' imperfectly proof read keying in of Original sanskrit works , the challenges of multiple transliteration schemas and ' Machine added Correction Challenges ( ! - any one using messaging in todays smart phones understand this 'Auto- suggestion' -replacement challenges easily ). The following resource could help one to trace the legacy of technology adaptation of Dictionaries in academics.

Ref:
<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qqdomnPTL9cC&dq=lexia&source=gbs_navlinks_s>
: Hypertext 3.0: Critical Theory and New Media in an Era of Globalization ; George P. Landow ; JHU Press, 2006 - Literary Criticism - 436 pages - George Landow's widely acclaimed Hypertext was the first book to bring together the worlds of literary theory and computer technology. Landow was one of the first scholars to explore the implications of giving readers instant, easy access to a virtual library of sources as well as unprecedented control of what and how they read. In hypermedia, Landow saw a strikingly literal embodiment of many major points of contemporary literary theory, particularly Derrida's idea of "de-centering" and Barthes's conception of the "readerly" versus "writerly" text.

From Intermedia to Microcosm, Storyspace, and the World Wide Web, Landow offers specific information about the kinds of hypertext, different modes of linking, attitudes toward technology, and the proliferation of pornography and gambling on the Internet. For the third edition he includes new material on developing Internet-related technologies, considering in particular their increasingly global reach and the social and political implications of this trend as viewed from a postcolonial perspective. He also discusses blogs, interactive film, and the relation of hypermedia to games. Thoroughly expanded and updated, this pioneering work continues to be the "ur-text" of hypertext studies.



2. You may look also take a look at my earlier requests on this forum, years ago under the thread title of ' Monier Williams Dictionary Revision and Upgrade', and seeking a helping hand to develop a specific project on ' Samskruth Lexicography Update' for 21 st century needs, starting from phase-1 : ' Update and Revise the MW Sanskrit English Dcitionary for needs of 21 st century.



 I have not received any helping response from any team !
Contra, many have taken the easy button route of plugging the 'data' from several projects and resources , resulting in spread of greater confusion and lessoning the clarity. Probably the pressure has not come to the bursting point !



 Pride is fine, only when backed with professionalism to justify and elvier the claims made through pride. Pride alone will not cause pain to subside.





3. The question raised by you touches the very basic issue of ' lexicography' which stands as foundational base for the next superstructure called academic research using lexicography and
building

the ivory tower of 'Translation- research- interpretation - Teaching Courses on line' and such claims which survive to make noise !

The deep question of ' Meaning and Scripture translation' is
buried below the hue and cry of ' Religion-Practice- Laws- Faith- Belief- Ritual-Culture- Heritage- Evangelism' and such sidetracking issues.



 This phenomenon is nothing exclusive to Samskrutham ! The langauge and meaning of Old Testament has been subjected to equal dissection and surgical construction ! 

\[ Nay, this has been the ' Kuru-kshetra' war-field of ' language-scholars', where sacrifce and slaughter due to personal animosities and value-perceptions of what one is defending as ' Bhashaa-

 Dharma' continues. \]

Following links may be useful for further exploration faced for
scholarly challenges in interpretation of liturgical latin texts and course of action they have taken, ever since 16th century, from UK base.

The ' meddling with text- lexicography' is a gift, technically an off shoot of church for keeping the ' heritage of religion-language-identity, alive and productive, relevant and a factor of socio-political,economic control ; and define ' We -They dichotomy with a motive to claim superiority. This 16th century church model was imposed on the understanding of 'Vedic Traditions' by Colonial Jesuit scholars in constructing the ' Sanskrit- English - Lexicons ' using
the model of ' Classical Latin-Greek-roman Langauge models'. This is explicitly, factually, consciously, stated as ' preferred methodology
used for construction of lexicography and transaltion by colonial scholars'. There is no need to question the motive or honesty or schoalrship of the scholars. 





4. What all I have heard so far as response to this challenge can be placed in two blocks:

One is ' itihaasa' -approach- :: It was said to be like this by our ' previous masters' (which brooks impossibility of verification.) \[ इति शुश्रुम पूर्वेंषां ये नः-तत्- व्याचचक्षिरे \]. (आचार्य-संप्रदायः)

 Second is ' self-Darshana- through Yoga -practice' ( स्वयं-दर्शन) No external proof needed . One is convinced of what has ' Visioned' / Hallucinated/ Constructed for self satisfaction ! एवं वै तत् सोम्य \]



 Beyond this, any thing else is ' PERSONAL PREFERRED OPINION' ( - ये -मे-मतमिदं- Gita :3-31 and 32).



5. How then should one arrive at the meaning of a given term marked as :

 ' (i) Belonging to the language class :Samskrutham संस्कृत-भाषा-इति-निर्दिष्टस्य-वाक्यान्तर्गत-पदानां- शास्त्र-रीत्या- अर्थग्रहणं-कथं ?

 (ii) part of a sentence 'said to be made up of
'Samskruth Terms'
पद-समुच्चय-रूपस्य-वाक्यस्य-तात्पर्य-अवधानं-कथं-प्रमाणीक्रियते?

(iii)By what set of rules and conventions to be aplied as authentic ?
निरुक्ति-को॔ष-परिभाषा-निष्कर्षः- संप्रदायः-कथं-प्रमाणीक्रयते ? \]





6. Based on this input, if you say which way you want to proceed, I am willing to be a team member in the venture.
