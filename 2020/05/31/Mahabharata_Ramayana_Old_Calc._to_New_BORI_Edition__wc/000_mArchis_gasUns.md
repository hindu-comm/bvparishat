Hariom,

  

All major bilingual Sanskrit dictionaries are based on text editions of XIX century. That means that the text editions, that are available now on the Internet are far from equal to the ones quoted, for example, in the Petersburger Sanskrit dictionaries.

Suppose I'm looking for \`rāvaṇa\` and in the ajective meaning \`schreien —, wehklagen machend\` it appears as per <https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/simple/pwg/ravana> in the form of \`sarvalokānām\` in \` R. 3, 36, 25.\` The only thing that can be said for sure, that it's in the 3rd book of Ramayana. To what \`3, 36\` does refers remains an open question. Similarly with \`loka°\` that equals to \`lokarāvaṇa\` in \`Mbh. 3, 11212.\` The only thing that can be said for sure, that it's in the 3rd book of Ramayana, but where to look for \`11212\`? If I open <http://mahabharata.manipal.edu/#/simdissim> I \`Select Parva\` easily, it's 03, but "Select chapter of BR" is where I stop. Because I do not know in Calcutta edition in which chapter is \`11212\`? So I can't verify the old quotes in new critical editions, as there are no concordances as I'm aware. Do I understand right that the pre-BORI popular editions (based on northern recension), including Nilakantha's commentary have never been OCRed?

I remember Arjun's paper that SHASTRI-VAVILLA and KUMBHAKONAM are very much the same and for the purpose of checking in the dictionaries even one of them is enough. Manipal's DIGITAL CONCORDANCE of MAHABHARATA I understand as Smith v. 2.0. But Prof Oliver Hellwig still uses the older, Smith v. 1.0 versions, that contains quite many mistakes at <http://sanskrit-linguistics.org/dcs/>.

  

I'm documenting such and similar cases at
<https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/> (including cases like <https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/PWG/issues/33>). I'm kindly asking anyone interested in Sanskrit lexicography to give as a helping hand.

  

  

On 33 pages (ix - xli)

<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.98210/page/n13/mode/2up> Concordance to the Bombay and Calcutta editions and P.C. Roy's translation. There was no other?
