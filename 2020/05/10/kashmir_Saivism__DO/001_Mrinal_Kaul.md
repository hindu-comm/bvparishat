Dear Mr Awasthi,

  

"Kashmir Śaivism" is a highly misnomer term. One should really understand what we mean by it. You most probably mean the non-dual Trika Śaivism of Kashmir. Unfortunately, there is not much good quality study available in Hindi language. But some of the best work is done by scholars like Vrajvallabh Dwivedi, Nilkanth Gurtu and Navjivan Rastogi. In general, I would recommend the two volumes of Prof Vrajvallabh Dwivedi for general study of Tantric tradition or Śaivism:

  

\- Dwivedi, Vrajavallabha. (2000) Tantrāgamīya Dharma Darśan, \[in Hindi\] Vol. I. Varanasi:ShaivaBharati Shodha Pratishthanam.

\- Dwivedi, Vrajavallabha. (2001) Tantrāgamīya Dharma Darśan, \[in Hindi\] Vol. II. Varanasi:ShaivaBharati Shodha Pratishthanam.

  

Navjivan Rastogi has these three wonderful books. For me they are written in very difficult Hindi since I am not a Hindi native speaker:

  

\- Rastogi, Navjivan. (2002) kāśmīra śivādvayavāda kī mūla avadhāranāeṃ, \[in Hindi\] MunshiramManoharlal, Delhi.

\- Rastogi, Navjivan. (2012) abhinavagupta kā tantrāgamīya darśan, \[in Hindi\], ViśvavidyālayaPrakāśan, Sāgar.

\- Rastogi, Navjivan. (2013) kāśmīra śivādvayavāda meṃ pramāṇa-cintana, \[in Hindi\] L.D. Sanskrit Series: 156, L.D. Institute of Indology, Ahmedabad.

  

Nilkanth Gurtu has the following translations available (his Hindi is even more difficult for a Kashmiri ear):

  

\- Gurtu, Nilakanth. (1981) Spandakārikā Śrībhaṭṭakallaṭa-vṛtti-sahitā (Hindi tr), MLBD, Delhi.

\- Gurtu, Nilakanth. (1985) Parātriśikāvivaraṇa, (Hindi tr), MLBD, Delhi.

\- Gurtu, Nilakanth. (2002) Sāṃbapañcāśikā with Kṣemāraja's commentary translated into Hindi,Penman Publishers, Delhi.

\- Gurtu, Nilakanth. (2004) Parmārthasāra with Hindi translation of Yogarāja's commentary with anelaborate introduction, Penman Publishers, Delhi.

  

Balajinnath Pandit also had a Hindi book titled "Kashmir Śaiva Darśan" published from Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, Jammu, but I don't have the exact reference. He also edited the following:

  

\- Paṇḍita, Balajinnātha. et al. (ed.) (2005) Kāśmīraśaivadarśanabṛhatkoṣaḥ, (2001) Vol. 1. Project Directorand Commentator Dr. Balajinnātha Paṇḍita Jammu (Jammu and Kashmir): Sri Ranbir Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha. Vol. 2. Project Director and Commentator Dr.Balajinnātha Paṇḍita Jammu (Jammu and Kashmir): Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan.

  

I hope this helps.
