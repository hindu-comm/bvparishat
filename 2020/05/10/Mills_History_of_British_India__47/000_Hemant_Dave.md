Dear all,

I am looking for Duncan Forbes's article 'James Mill and India' published in *Cambridge Journal* (Oct.) 1951, pp. 19-33. As far as I could see, it is not available on Jstor or on the Cambridge Core. Google Books has it but only snippet view.<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rrzfAAAAMAAJ&dq=cambridge%20journal%2C%20duncan%20forbes%2C%20james%20mill%20and%20india&source=gbs_book_other_versions>

Any help in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Best,

Hemant
