Shri Sivasenani has given a brilliant and complete answer to your question.

  

Let me like a squirrel add a little more (yatha-shakti):

  

"Some people believe that the chanting of ॐकार is prohibited for women."

  

--> My suggestion please stop asking "people" what to do. Ask experts. By experts I refer topeople who have studied shastra at the expense of artha and kAma. Nothing is attained in this world without sacrifice and see if the people you ask are shraddhaalus and not limited to mere verbiage.

Ask people who are adhikaaris. This will exclude certain "indologists" and their local lapdogs like Devdutt Pattnaik.

If you wish to board a flight you want to know that it was designed by people who competently passed out of an accredited aeronautics course and were not mere hobbyists, however gifted.

Hollywood may think otherwise but they sell dreams.

  

Regarding praNava and gAyatri:

  

--> Have you considered the plausible reason that a psychology of "desire for the forbidden fruit " is acting in both cases?

The reason the vedas are considered sacrosanct is that they are apaurusheya, timeless beyond conception of past present and future (athato brahmajijnasa....NOW is the only timeframe suggested) and come through the instrument of uttamaadhikaaris namely the rshis.

-->I am not aware of the atharvashirsha having any constraints..please correct me if I am wrong.

  

We came into this world through our mother and she introduced us to the father. None of us asked for a DNA certificate or other "scientific" proof of paternity. So also the shastra is like a loving mother who cares equally for all Her children. The advice is meant for each person's evolution and not to marginalise or belittle.

  

It is possible that in the long hoary past women also were given upavita --I believe there is a separate thread about that on BVP...I am given to understand Harita has written much in that regard.

--> There are plenty of mantras in tantra and shlokas of wonderful efficacy given in the Mahabharata the most popular of which is the Vishnu Sahasranama.

  

Tukaram one of the greatest saints the world has seen was initiated in a dream and his mantra was nothing fancy.

Eye witnesses recorded that Vimanas with Vishnudutas came to take him away.

Such is the power of shraddha.

  

1\) Did such prohibition exist?

 ----> Unless you have access to a sampradaya that initiates the ladies (as given by Harita etc.), it is best to accept the default setting and persevere within the rules. Experimentation is very very dangerous for some one committed. Chanting once or twice will not give any bad effects since most people even the adhikaaris for this japa rarely have the spiritual development necessary to see the results.

I'll give a real story:- A disciple of a tantric Guru took vArAhi sadhana and started his japa at a lonely spot. After sometime a pig started visiting him and the pig liked sitting next to him. The austere sadhaka was offended and had a feeling of revulsion/disgust in the mind. Shortly thereafter he started vomitting blood. When he consulted the Guru he told the disciple that his devata had visited him in the form of a pig and his disgust had resulted in his sadhana giving contrary and rather frightening results.

This was due to lack of shraddha.

  

The above example is an extreme one and does not apply to Vedic mantras which are more forgiving, but still that would not be an excuse for experimentation.

Most Gurus these days even the ones with fancy siddhis are not uttamaadhikaaris.

The rshis belong to a different level even among uttamaadhikaaris and it is best to follow their advice rather than pit our limited intellect and drishti with theirs. "yatha drishti tatha srishti"



“A man goes to knowledge as he goes to war: wide-awake, with fear, with respect, and with absolute assurance. Going to knowledge or going to war in any other manner is a mistake, and whoever makes it might never live to regret it”  

--Carlos Cataneda

  

Approaching anything especially vidya without complete awareness and surrender is dangerous.

  

Yes Gayatri does create a lot of heat in the body especially if your japa count goes consistently into the thousands per day. Men have reasonably simple plumbing and they have problems. I assume the more complicated plumbing of ladies makes them susceptible to health issues.

Gayatri is after all the power of the Sun. /Savita.

  

2\) If so, what were the reasons behind the popularization of such notion?

--> I am speculating here and if any of the vidvans have source please provide the same (for /against)-->

I am addressing here the reason for the advice of the rshis and not addressing "vox populi"

  1. The different physiology of women and their greater material responsibilities

  2. If a lady gets abstracted in Brahman who is going to look after the mundane activities of the household?

     The woman is the creatrix and perpetuator of the Vedic system and she automatically gets 50% of the result of all the japa and homa of her pati.      Elsewhere the definition of patni is one who assists at the 5 sacrifices.

  3. The time investment required for sandhyavandana, japa, samitadhana/agnihotra, brahmayajna etc. is rather significant. Gotras would have vanished due to starvation if women were to have their own nityakarma.

4\. The Vedic system is one of division of responsibility whether it is varnaashrama dharma or grihastaashrama dharma. The lady of the house had her own responsibilities adjacent to the man's that assisted in the Vedic process. Each did his/her part and they shared in the results. Isn't that a beautiful partnership?

3\) Is there any scientific study conducted in present times which throws light on the repercussions of the chanting of these Mantras especially ॐकार on the human body. especially on women's? 

--> While Science as defined as the observation and codification of nature as observed in experimentation is sacrosanct scientists are not.

Some Scientists have made science into a quasi religion with the same levels of bigotry and preachiness that the medieval church exhibited.

The common people dutifully follow this "scientific temper" as sacrosanct ignoring the fact that much of modern science is funded by vested interests with access to purse strings. The scientists themselves are not above cultural bias and bigotry.

As in all things ignorance is bliss.

  

Lastly if anyone needs the validation of Science or a Scientist for the Gayatri or Pranava, it is better to take the scientist as a Guru and forget all these mantras...just saying ;-)

  

As Shri Sivasenani pointed out there are hidden effects at work everywhere and the limited materialist vision of men cannot penetrate into the marma behind the drishti of rshis.

Why do I say this? I know because when I started I questioned everything "traditional", followed my own drum beat and regretted everything.

Atleast I am thankful that I was given a chance to rectify and course correct within this lifetime.

  

As in all things to each his/her own.

  

All the best,

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
