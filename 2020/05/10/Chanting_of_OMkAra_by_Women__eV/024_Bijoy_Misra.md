Dear friends,

I have not read the whole thread fully, but it seems to me that some church psychology

might be in play. I would think we have to be more liberal and more experiential than  

accepting written word or instruction anywhere. Empiricism does work, but the sun

does not arise in the east! Our scriptures are larger than the "views".

Best regards,

BM
