Dear Shri Murthy Garu:  

  

I am not here to comment about your understanding of English, but I can only clarify what I have written in case it has been misunderstood.

  

It is not important that two people follow/peruse the same book or "sampradaya" ...as long as two hearts are open and there is place for satya and vichara,communication will happen at some level.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
