Chanting "Om" while exhaling air using our navel, kanth and lips is one thing. It definitelygives a good feeling. No wonder! However, we are producing a sound deliberately becausewe want to feel good or DIVINE.

  

Havingsaid that, there is a "unique point" in our head (also called Brahmand in Vedic terminology) when our mind is focus onto that point then one gets to hear "OM" sound. This OM sound is constantly
happening in everyone's head whether male or female. It is only a matter of reversing the flow of mindfrom outward to inward (to that point).

  

When I say unique point means I really mean it.

  

People focus too much on theory and not on practical (sadhan abhyaas). Just as in science there is theory and practical. One cannot learn too much about science just by grammar and discussion, instead if she/he wants to experience it they have do some practical in the laboratory.

  

Similarly in Vedic science philosophy, scholarlydiscussion on Mantra is one thing and knowing how to execute or see through that mantra (practical) is another thing.

  

Kind regards,
