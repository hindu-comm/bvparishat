Thank you, Sir.

1\. It is incorrect to equatethe varnashrama system with modern professions. The bane of the Varnashrama system is the aspect of its inheritance.

2\. I am not a meat-eater. Yet I consider it wrong to call meat-eating obnoxious. After all. even in India vegetarians are a minority. There would certainly be meat eaters in BVP too. The points you have listed are your personal opinion and are debatable.

I seek to be educated on whether our dharmashastras deal with andhashraddhaa.

Warm regards,

Murthy
