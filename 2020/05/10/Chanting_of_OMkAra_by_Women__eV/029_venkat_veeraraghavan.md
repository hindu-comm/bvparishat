Dear Shri Manish ji,

  

Thank you for your post about theory vs practice.

  

I think you meant "brahmarandhra"?

  

While everything that you say is true, there is some context to be considered here:-

  

1\. The original questioner has asked for precedence and what is adhikara for women in terms of pranava / gayatri. --> with such a question, theory based on shastra and precedence is what can be discussed.

  

2\. While the journey of chanting is varied and changes from person to person based on the vagaries of personal karma, the end effects are described in many books.

What the books do not describe is the personal hell(the journey) that unprepared people (men and women) go through when they start on this "quest" and travel with persistence and determination.

  

There is a saying in Tamil "Sivan sotthukula naasam" -- it literally translates to "Shiva's property brings about ruination of the kula". Many take this to mean that if one appropriates the property of a Siva temple one's lineage is destroyed.

While this may be true of any temple and not just Siva's, the real meaning is a little more deeper.

Siva's only true wealth are those who seek Him,for he owns nothing (material that is). Siva yogis are the ones who are called urdhvaretas (ones with vital seed drawn up). Such people cannot have a kula.

Now kula vriddhi is not the only aspect affected.

  

Money flow stops, relatives and friends desert you. Health problems appear.

Now all this does not apply to the journeyman/woman who shops around the spiritual "market" but to one who really commits to the path.

This is the reason Dhruva, Vishvamitra and almost all rshishad to leave everything and stay in lonely places like forests to limit the damage.

There were some exceptional women among these too, but they were fewer than the men because women have more responsibilities to deal with.

The rshis therefore in their wisdom gave directions on safe evolution for both men and women.

None of the people in the present marketplace who call themselves yogis come anywhere close even to the strata of rshis in terms of depth of vision and understanding.

  

3\. Theory and precedence is what can be given. Any person even if they have personal experience will not bring themselves forward to discuss such things in public or private.

There is a tradition you may have observed in Ramayana and the Mahabharata where when a rshi is asked for guidance, they source from the lives of other rshisand avoid bringing themselves forward.

This is a very crucial aspect of shishtacharaand a basic protocol that most follow.

  

4\. Pravrtti and Nivrtti are two different directions on the same path. Each requires a different set of gunas to successfully accomplish. If both are to be maintained simultaneously a very high level of detachment and control over the senses is required--something that only yogabhrashtas of a very high caliber are likely to possess. The rest will have trouble in both spheres.

  

Therefore in such a case shastra is the only reliable eye with which one can see farther than our senses show us. This is where shraddha and vishvaasacomes in.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
