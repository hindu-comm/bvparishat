Saadaram Namonamah,

  

Some people believe that the chanting of ॐकार is prohibited for women. The popular rationale given for this is 'the huge amount of heat in ॐकार induces her internal heat and it may prove to be harmful for her health.' Many Yoga Practitioners (at least those who are in my acquaintance) have varied opinions in this regard. Such prohibition also exist in the cases of practice of गायत्री मन्त्र and अथर्वशीर्ष स्तोत्र by women.

  

My questions are-

1\) Did such prohibition exist?

2\) If so, what were the reasons behind the popularization of such notion?

3\) Is there any scientific study conducted in present times which throws light on the repercussions of the chanting of these Mantras especially ॐकार on the human body. especially on women's? 

  

I sincerely request all eminent scholars of this group to guide on this topic.  

Thank you all!
