Dear Shri Paturi Garu

  

Shri Murthy Garu: "I am not a meat-eater. Yet I consider it wrong to call meat-eating obnoxious."

Where have I called meat-eating obnoxious? Please re-read.

  

I admire many meat eaters including and not limited to Rama, Krishna and in modern times Vivekananda, but this would not be place to quote "yad yad aacharati sreshtaH.."..since the subjective context is totally absent in the present mileu.

I called the *meat industry and the industry driven FDA recommendations* obnoxious from the pov of dharma. Where is the life-style aspect here for anyone to take umbrage?

  

Even when animals were sacrificed, something was given back and they were ensured higher rebirths.

Taking without compensation is considered stheya/stealing in dharma.

I am not making any value judgements on meat eaters either here on BVP or elsewhere. As in everything, to each his/her own. Dharma can be indicated but never forced as in BG where Krishna ended the dialogue with "yatha icchasi tatha kuru..".

  

My point in illustrating what I considered obnoxious in modern society is that:

1\. Shri Murthy Garu was intent on drawing conclusions based on the prejudices of the present zeitgeist. I merely illustrated the above points to note that these were not the actions of a balanced / wise society. Afterall for a person's opinion to count even within this forum there has to be a basic level of understanding of cause-effect and grounding in traditional disciplines.

Many are willing to laugh at Kalidasa cutting off the branch from the root while sitting on the unsafe side, while many of our own actions are no better. WIth such a context do the prejudices of this "modern society" deserve the oxygen in public discourse?

2\. A society that pursues never ending profits at the cost of nature is neither wise nor capable of reflection.

3\. You cannot use a system with completely different paradigms (the present society and its prejudices) to decide whether there is value or not in dharmashastras which have an entirely different non-predatory paradigm.

  

Shri Murthy garu: "The bane of the Varnashrama system is the aspect of its inheritance."

  

Kindly watch "the last samurai".

The script writers of that movie had a better idea of the advantages of varna when compared to many Indians itwould seem.

  

Colonel Bagley: "The rebels don't have any rifles.They're savages with bows and arrows."  

Nathan Algren : "Whose sole occupation for the last one thousand years has been war."

  

If done properly, there is nothing like it. Done badly nothing worse.

So, there is a context to everything. :)

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
