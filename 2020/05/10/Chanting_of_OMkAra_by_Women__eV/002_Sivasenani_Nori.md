Sanhita ji, namaste.

  

I write in the belief (based on your signature etc.) that you are a seeker interested in furthering your saadhanaa, and that your intention is not like that of Dr. Ananya Vajapeyi (<https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/the-story-of-my-sanskrit/article6321759.ece>) who studied Dharmasastra to only criticize it and those who taught her for three years, an act of kritaghnatA.

  

श्रद्धावाल्लँभते ज्ञानम् - भगवद्गीता, 4.13 ।

**The one with SraddhA obtains knowledge.**

  

The word SraddhA needs elaboration, especially since it is often used in the sense of 'diligence' in Indian languages. In SAstra, it is better translated as faith. Here are a few references to support the same:

  

मन्तव्यविषये आदरः आस्तिक्यबुद्धिः श्रद्धा। Sankaracharya's bhashya on Chandogyopanishat 7.19.1 ॥

(Sraddha is respect for, and belief in, the topic of discussion)

  

श्रद्धा अदृष्टार्थेषु कर्मसु आस्तिक्यबुद्धिः देवतादिषु च, अश्रद्धातद्विपरीता बुद्धिः। Sankaracharya's bhashya on Br. Up. 1.5.3 ॥

(Sraddha is belief in karma which has adrishTa (= paapa, puNya) as its result and in gods; Asraddha is the reverse of that).  

  

श्रद्धा ... आस्तिक्यबुद्धिः। Sankaracharya's bhashya on Mu. Up. 2.1.7 ॥

(Sraddha is belief)

  

सर्वत्रास्तिकता श्रद्धा । bhAshyaratnaprabhA while explaining the sAdhanasampat ॥

(Everywhere, Sraddha is belief)

  

गुरुवेदान्तवाक्येषु विश्वासःश्रद्धा। vedAntaparibhAshA, under prayojanam while explaining SamadamAdishaTkam॥ (

Sraddha is faith in the Guru and Vedantic sentences)

  

शास्त्रस्य गुरुवाक्यस्य सत्यबुद्धयावधारणा। सा श्रद्धा कथिता सद्भिर्यया वस्तूपलभ्यते॥ 26, Vivekachudamani ॥

(Determining SAstra and the teaching of Guru as true is called Sraddha, that which is a necessary condition for attaining the desired goal)

  

गुरूपदिष्टवेदान्तवाक्येषु विश्वासःश्रद्धा। vedAntasAra ॥

(Faith in the Vedantic sentences taught by Guru is Sraddha)  

  

One has to approach Sastra with Sraddha, with faith that what is said in Sastra and what the teacher of Sastra is saying is true. One might say that this is strange, especially if one is skeptical. Since modern education in India cultivates skepticism, this is worth a brief examination. Let us keep religion aside and examine certain values, which hold true for most human beings, including the irreligious, areligious, non-religious, athiestic and skeptic ones (whichever label they prefer). Let us examine only one value - bhUtadayA - helping other creatures. Why is this good? From evolutionary biology we know that each creature tries to survive and procreate itself; then what explains this very uncharacteristic approval of acting against one's self-interest? If one says what when we help others, dopamine etc. are produced in our body which make us happy, we must be smart enough to know that such a reaction in body is there to encourage certain social behaviour and that one cannot always follow that. If one were to only rely on the harmones produced by body, all of us should eat whenever food is available, becoming super obese; yet, we know better and limit our food intake. I am yet to come across a satisfactory explanation of why widely-held human values are rational, or 'scientific' if you will. We simply believe that some things are valid and cannot prove them right by logic or reasoning.

  

In fact, you dig deeper, all Science is based on axioms. Similar in religion, we need to have a minimal set of axioms. We call that faith in religious terms. Or Sraddha. For Buddhists, faith is imposed in the word of Buddha; for followers of Sanatanadharma, Vedas are right; and so on.

  

To view the same from a different point of view, the doctrine of Sraddha says that somethings can be understood only when you make a sincere effort to do so and such sincerity is not possible, if inside your mind, you harbour doubts. Personally, I was caught in this dichotomy between skepticism borne out of a modern education and sanskaara ingrained from early upbrining, for about sixteen years. Then, while studying Vedanta, it dawned upon me - after much pain, let me add - that I am an adhamaadhikaari or madhyamaadhikaari, and simply cannot 'get it', as long as I harbour doubts and as long as I do not do adequate saadhanaa. In sum, one needs Sraddha to understand Sastra.

  

And before directly answering your questions, let me briefly touch upon adhikAra. In Bhoja's champUrAmAyaNa, just before going to vanavAsa Rama meets Kaikeyi and says मयि पतति गरीयानम्ब ते पक्षपातः - "Mother, you are being partial towards me, compared to Bharata":

  

वनभुवि तनुमात्रत्राणमाज्ञापितं मे, सकलभुवनभारः स्थापितो वत्समूर्ध्न।

तदिह सुकरतायामावयोस्तर्कितायां मयि पतति गरीयानम्ब ते पक्षपातः ॥ 25, अयोध्याकाण्डम् ॥

(O mother!youhave given me the meagreresponsibility of protecting myself from wild beasts, and have asked the young Bharata to bear this huge burden ofprotecting the kingdom from allkinds of dangers; if we compare the ease of tasks, between the two of us, you are partial to me.)  

  

The maryAdapurusha understands kshAtradharma clearly and sees ruling a kingdom as a responsibility, not a right, or a luxury.Similarly, the adhikAra for VedAdhyana should be seen as a responsibility.

  

Now, to answer your questions.

  

1\. There is a probhibition against women reciting mantras, because one needs to be initiated (upavIta) and no rite of initiation has been specified for women. So it is not a direct prohibition, but is a deduced position based on the absence of certain enabling procedures. This is better viewed as women not having the responsibility of learning Veda, reciting all of what was learnt at once a month for forty years (svAdhyAya) etc. It does not mean exclusion from worship etc. Instead of a mantras, Slokas are to be used while worshipping etc. The teaching of Veda is also made available through Ramayana, Mahabharata, Puranas etc.

  

praNavopAsana is ordained only for Sannyasins; grihastas - both male and female - are not supposed to upAsana of kevalapraNava, but it can be used at the beginning of mantras etc. I am not aware of any prohibition of women reciting 'om' at all, especially from the standpoint of haThayoga, but the doctrine of Sraddha shows us that we need to take this from a Guru in that Sastra.

  

2\. To the extent, prohibitions are there, reasons are explained above. An additional remark is not out of place here. If there is a drishTArtha (visible result), then adrishTArtha (invisible result, accrual of puNya) is not used to explain any injunction; but that does not mean that adrishTArtha is not a valid reason. If Veda says, 'pound the grain' (व्रीहीनवहन्ति), one pounds the grain and does not ask questions like 'can I not use my nails to remove the chaff'. If Sastra lays down something, it is like Raajaajnaa (in Alankarasastra, this is called prabhusammitaa) and has to be done; no questions are permitted. The attempts to explain the various injunctions are either attempts at understanding Sastra better (agreeable) or rationalization (not agreeable - by definition, we have faith in Sastra, and do not do something because it is rational).

  

3\. No, to my knowledge there are no studies about heat being produced by reciting omkAra,. For many centuries, people had this urge to verify what has been said in Sastra. The results are called adrishTArtha for a reason. Let me narrate a small episode - from Mimamsa, but Nyaya also has a version of it. There is a Vedic injunction - चित्रया यजेत पशुकामः (Taittiirya Samhita, 2.4.6) - one desirous of animals may do the Chitrayaga. Now a skeptic questions this by first showing a person, who has performed Chitrayaga, but did not get any pashus; then, he also points to another one, who got pashus, but did not perform the Chitrayaaga. The answer of the Sastrin is: "Veda says one will get animals, but it was not said whether one would get them in this janma only or later janmas; also the very fact that the other fellow obtained animals shows that he has performed Chitrayaaga in earlier janmas". Hence I quoted this Vedic sentenceश्रद्धा अदृष्टार्थेषु कर्मसु आस्तिक्यबुद्धिःabove. Where there is Sraddha, one does not seek proof, definiely not where adrishTa is involved.

  

Finally, let it be known that there are myriad paths to what we seek. One reaches much farther when one approaches a goal with humility, rather than with angst.
