Dear Shri Murthy Garu-->  

  

Very very interesting take.

" In matters of rights and duties of women, it is women who we have to hear from. "

  

Really? Do men get to do the same? I guess many men would argue that they have to wake up in Brahma muhurta do sandhyavandana, agnikarya Brahma yajna in addition to having to make a living.

  

Trust me it is not fun...not even for those who strictly adhere to the standards out of a sense of shraddha or duty.

  

" श्रद्धा could be invoked even to defend the castesystem, which has been rejected in the modern world. "

  

Are you suggesting that the modern world and its zeitgeist are an authority on dharma shastras and how it is to be interpreted?

If you reject the dharmshastras based on modern viewpoint you are welcome to do so. But in seeking to redefine dharmashastra you also betray a need to modify the vehicle to suit the current mindset.

If Krishna said in the BG that He created the 4 varnas do you seriously think there have been greater figures of authority in recent times to second guess and improve thehierarchy?

I understand the difference betweenvarna and jaati so lets not go there.

Even in the modern world there are shudras (almost everyone who works for some one else without intellectual independence), Vaishyas (Businessmen), Kshatriyas (army/police) and Brahmanas (PhDs, researchers, professors etc...

The only difference is that theydontuse that moniker....and all their work is directed at OUTER things and not INNER values

If you suggest that modern humans have the capacity to second guess the rshis, then why even bother redefining the dharmashastras? Why not throw them out altogether and follow sveccha since that is what you are suggesting?

  

Asking the people what they want amounts to that alone.

  

I can think of many obnoxious things that the modern society approves of:

1\. Slaughterhouses /Go-hatya

2\. Doctors say masturbation is essential for "male health"

3\. Meat is good for you and a great source of protein

4\. GM crops will solve world hunger

5\. Babies deciding what sex they want to be (YAY!!!)..boys can legally now wrestle girls claiming that they identify as women....

6\. Human fetuses canned as food ( in certain parts of the world)

7\. Eating bats, snakes, roaches everything that crawls/flies

8\. Gain of function in Virology that has resulted in the pretty big covid19 dump that the world is now looking at

  

I can go on with this list, but I will not.

  

Please understand that this is a choice for those who believe in the dharmashastras.

The rest do not have to bother with it at all.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
