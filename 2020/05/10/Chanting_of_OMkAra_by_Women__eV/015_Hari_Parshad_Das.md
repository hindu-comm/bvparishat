I would like to highlight an important point which has not been highlighted previously.

  

In various places in Vedic literature, women have been categorized into — **(1)** brahmavādinī and **(2)** sadyovadhū.

  

The former had access to learning the Vedas (some say even teaching it). The latter did not. Here is a quote from the **Vīramitrodayaḥ**:

  

***dvividhāḥ striyaḥ. brahma-vādinyaḥ sadyo-vadhvaś ca. tatra brahma-vādinīnām upanayanam agnīndhanaṁ vedādhyayanaṁ sva-gṛhe-ca bhikṣācaryā iti. sadyo-vadhūnāṁ tūpasthite vivāhe kathañcid-upanayana-mātraṁ kṛtvā vivāhaḥ kāryaḥ***

  

**Translation**: There are two types of ladies — the brahmavādinī, who doesn‘t desire to marry, and the sadyo-vadhū. For the brahmavādinī there is provision for receiving the sacred thread, conducting the fire sacrifice, studying the Vedas, and begging alms at her own home. The sadyovadhū at the time of marriage should only be invested with the sacred thread and then married. (***Hārīta-sṃrti*21.23,Also quoted in the Vīramitrodaya, Samskāra-prakāśa (pp 402,403,404,405) ofMahāmahopādhyāya Paṇḍita Mitra Miśra, Edited by P.N. Sharma, Chowkhamba SanskritSeries, Printed by Jai Krishna Das Gupta, Vidya Vilas Press, Benares. 1919.**)

  

Sri Madhvacharya also quotes the ***Vyoma-saṃhitā*** in the beginning of his ***brahma-sūtra-bhāṣyam***:

  

***āhur apy uttama-strīṇām adhikāraṃ tu vaidike***

***yathorvaśī yamī caiva śacy ādyāś ca tathāparāḥ***

  

**Translation**: It is said that for uttama-strī, there is adhikāra in Vedic literature, and the examples are Urvasi, Yami, Saci and other women sages.

  

Now there are vidvans who argue and say that uttama-strī only means "heavenly" lady. To this, the sub-commentary "candrikā" specifies that the term "ādyāḥ" includes ladies born in human families.

  

Still there are vidvāns who argue that no strī is uttama in today's age. This argument could go on forever.

  

sādhu-caraṇa-rajo'bhilāṣī,

  

hari parshad das.
