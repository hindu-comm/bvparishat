Just trying to understand the implementation part of the above statement since there is this mention of 'upanayana is for vedadhyayanaand the devataa-s are naturally endowed with Veda-jnana (without the need for upanayanam and vedadhyayanam) in the Brahma sutra bhashya of Shankara:
devataadhikaraNam 1.3.26:

  

उपनयनस्य वेदाध्ययनार्थत्वात् , तेषां च*स्वयंप्रतिभातवेदत्वात्*; अपि चैषां विद्याग्रहणार्थं ब्रह्मचर्यादि दर्शयति

  

This is because there is no varna ashrama dharma for Devataa-s. They are not born into any caste so as to segregate some as having veda adhikara and some not having it.

  

Whether 'vaidike' means/implies vedadhyayanam or adhikara for Veda pratipaadita Atma vidya. The above passage of Shankara goes on to give instances where Indra, etc. observed brahmacharya for hundreds of years to obtain Atma vidya.

  

When it comes to Deva stri-s having adhikara for veda, it has to be seen how this is implemented in Deva loka. Whether there were veda pathashala-s, etc. The statement of Shankara gives the impression that such is not the case as the reasoning: no varna ashrama vidhis for devataa-s.

  

Any clarification is welcome.

  

warm regards
