Here is the view of a ज्ञानलवदुर्विदग्ध :

पुराणमित्येव न साधु सर्वम् ।

In matters of rights and duties of women, it is women who we have to hear from. श्रद्धा could be invoked even to defend the castesystem, which has been rejected in the modern world. If there is a discussion in dharmashastras about when श्रद्धा turns into अन्धश्रद्धा, scholars could throw light on it despite ब्रह्मापि मां न रञ्जयति ।

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
