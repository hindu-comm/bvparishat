चिन्त्य mfn. (-न्त्यः-न्त्या-न्त्यं)

1 To be considered.

3 To be thought of or meditated upon,  

  

     As per Garbhopanishad,
(****अक्षरमोङ्कारं*****चिन्तयति---\_)**********t**his context is explained in the 8th*month of pregnancy, where progeny itself recollects orJiva gets the capacity to know its past karma (of past births), by meditatingon Atman as Om, through perfect knowledge and meditation. Having known Om, progeny sees in the body the eight Prakritis derived from it the five elements, mind, intellect and ego, and the sixteen vikaras.

  

 Thank you, sir.
