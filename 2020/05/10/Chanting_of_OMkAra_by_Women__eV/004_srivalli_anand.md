Many Namaskarams Sri SivasenaniMahodaya.

  

The answer to this question that was placed is so universally applicable to our Dharma. We, youngsters who wish to convincingly answer queries that arise every now and then, have had an eye opener in your answer.
It reminds me of how our Guru used to insist - "दुस्तर्कात् सुविरम्यतां श्रुतिमतस्तर्कोऽनुसन्धीयताम्" . The axioms that we so gladly assume and accept in all sciences somehow are questioned when it comes to Sanatanadharma. That is not to say that questioning is discouraged. On the contrary, it is the basis of our Sastras to question. However your explanation on the basic axiom of श्रद्धा being the essential prerequisite was such a revelation.

Thank you Sir.

  

Namaskrams,

Srivalli Anand
