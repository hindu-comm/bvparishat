   Namaste to all Respected teachers,

  

 1)पञ्चात्मकतेजसेद्धरसश्च सम्यग्ज्ञानात् ध्यानात्

****अक्षरमोङ्कारं**** ****चिन्तयति**** । तदेतदेकाक्षरं ज्ञात्वाऽष्टौ

प्रकृतयः षोडश विकाराः शरीरे तस्यैवे देहिनाम् । (गर्भोपनिषत् १७)

 2) Astanga Hrudaya  Shareerasthana 1st chapter Garbhaavakranti
Adhyaya 33 shloka, to get good progeny they have to chant this mantra which starts with Om kar itself.

3) Charaka Samhita Shareerasthana of 8th chapter,  during delivery 
physician should chant some mantras in the ear of mother, for safe
delivery.

4\) In Yoni Vyapat chikitsa of charaka samhita chikitsa sthana 30th chapter also there is no such causative factor for 20 types yoni vyapat diseases. ( Ahita Ahara-vihara, daiva factor is mentioned-Purvajanma kruta karma.)

        As per my understanding, with above said references , there is no restriction to chant Om kar for women.
