Dear Shri Bijoy Mishra ji:-

  

If you have not read the thread fully, why do you bother to give a verdict--"church pyschology" etc?

Would that not be prejudice on your part to do so?

  

If you have issues with specific parts of the narrative in this thread, feel free to share why and how some view is wrong. And do give a counter narrative so that the rest of us can benefit from your wisdom.

  

"Empiricism does work, but the sun

does not arise in the east!"

  

I am confused by this statement, can you please clarify?

  

"Our scriptures are larger than the "views". "  

  

These "views" as you call them come from people who know and practise "sishtaachara".

It is the person(s) who practise sishtacharawho deserves to answer a question on dharma and not otherwise.

Shri Sivasenani, Shri Korada and many others are such people.

  

The original questionerput their query to people within the fold of sishtachara and wished for an explication.

When a questioner with angst approaches any assembly for resolution, it is dharma to solve the person's doubt yathashakti. Which is what most people here have done.

  

Shri Sivasenani has given his views.

  

If you have any counterviews from your own realm of theory and practise, do share.

  

Instead posting such generalised comments tarring everyone who doesntagree with a liberal "view" of dharmashastra as a bigot. This is a rather old and well worn tactic and unworthy of BVP.

  

Please understand that thequestioner has asked about what happens in sampradayas (which is the subtext of the question).

So the answer also has to come from people who *belong and practise* in such lineages.

Again, please keep your replies specific and kindly avoid needless generalisations, we all wait for your wisdom.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
