Two opportunities, it is said, present themselves before the *jIva*,

when it can recollect its pristine purity viz. pre-arrival & post-departure:  

in the womb as alluded to above, and at the moment of death

\- verily, the two "turning points" of life.  

  

In the former, the *jIva* "resolves" to resort to *sAn'khya* and *yoga*, and never get trapped again;

and in the latter, getting a glimpse of the *summum bonum*.

  

But alas, as to the former : the resolution gets "muted" by *vaiShNavI-mAyA*,

and the *pUrva-vAsanA*-s overwhelm the *jIva*  

who is ushered - back into the pavilion of *saMsAra*,

to work his *karman*-s out.

  

And in the latter, the helpless *jIva*, poor perdu, unable to hold on to the grand vision,

is swept off the feet by the tsunami of the *saMskAra*-s earned all through life.

  

That is why:

***pūrve vayasi tat kuryād yena vṛddhaḥ sukhaṁ vaset \|  
***

***yāvaj jīvena tat kuryād yena pretya sukhaṁ vaset \|\|  
***

*  
*

All life is to be a planning, thus : as a preparation for death !*  
*

The art of living is indeed the art of dying.
