Hariom,

  

In this screen shot- (VcpSkd-01 and VcpSkd-01a) there is an अदा which means अदादि dhAtu, पर is परस्मैपदी, and सक is सकर्मक। and hence अदा is the abbreviation which properly makes sense as the dhAtu vibhAga. That everybody can understand.

  

In the second set of screen shots, (VcpSkd-02 and VcpSkd-02a, and b) अद् is not connectible with any attribute pertaining to dhAtu. चु means चुरादि। उभ means उभयपदी। And the अद् remains out of context and does not describe any of the dhAtu attributes.

अस विद्यमानतायाम् अदा० अक० पर० सेट् ।

VcpSkd-01a

  

In the SKD - the अदादि is written as अदा.. but we find one more अद् whose full-form is not known. Can you help?

  

M.
