Namaste,

  

You may find the following thesis useful.

<https://archive.org/details/srividyaschoolsaktatantrismstudyoftextscontextsinlivingtraditionsofsouthindiadog_202003_158_E>

  

You will find more books at [archive.org](http://archive.org). Use keywords 'kerala tantra' and 'tantrism south india'.

  

There is also 'Kali worship in Kerala' by C Achyuta Menon, available at [archive.org](http://archive.org). It is in Malayalam. I am not sure whether it has been translated into Englsih.  

  

regards  
shankara
