Sir,

  

I have that book on order for another requester, but because of the virus I can't predict whether the package will reach me or not, or when it'll reach me. Hence, if you need the book urgently, it's better not to rely on me. All I can promise is that once I get my hands on it, I'll share it with you. Sorry not to be of immediate help, but under the circumstances it's just not prudent to promise more.

  

Irene
