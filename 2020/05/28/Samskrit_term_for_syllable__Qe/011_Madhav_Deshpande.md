The best source for the notion of syllable in Indian phonetics is:

  

Siddheshwar Varma (1929).*[Critical Studies In The Phonetic Observations Of Indian Grammarians](https://books.google.com/books?id=MfuwbwAACAAJ)*

*

Varma elaborately discusses this notion in the Prātiśākhyas, where the notion of akṣara is elaborated. Normally, the preceding consonant goes with the following vowel to form an akṣara. If a vowel is followed by two consonants, then the first of the two consonants goes with the preceding vowel. Anusvāra and visarga go with the preceding vowel.
This is just the briefest outline, while Varma has elaborate discussions.
