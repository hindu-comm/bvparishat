Dear Pandey Ji,

  

  Don't overlook the extensive discussions of akṣara in the sense of syllable in the Prātiśākhyas elaborated in English in his book by Siddheshwar Varma that mentioned in the previous email. Any statement saying "perhaps there is no need," should only be made after consulting such works. With best regards,
