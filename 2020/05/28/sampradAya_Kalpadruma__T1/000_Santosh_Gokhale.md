Dear Scholars,

  

I am looking for long for a book called 'Sampradāya Kalpadruma' byVitthalanātha or manaraṃjana kavi.

It is apparently aPushtimargiyaVaishnava Sampradaya text, which has been extensively referred to by R B Athawale in his writings on Jagannatha Pandita, but all my searches for this book have served futile.

  

Can anyone guide me to a soft/hard copy of the said text, as also comment on its relevance in the Pushtimargatradition?

  

Kind regards

Santosh
