Dear Niranjan Ji,

  

According to this, "roam" is derived from a root that yields रिणाति in Sanskrit.

  

<https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h%E2%82%83reyH->

  

We know that Rama (राम) is derived from रम् verb stem (enjoy, delight, rest, etc.). For example, रमन्ते योगिनो यस्मिन् चिदानन्दे चिदात्मनि in the शाङ्करभाष्य on विष्णुसहस्रनाम. Additional etymologies can be found in the Adhyatma Ramayana and Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (जो आनंद सिंधु सुखरासी। सीकर तें त्रैलोक सुपासी।।). From the perspective of Vyakarana, राम is constructed by applyingघञ् प्रत्यय toरम्. The learned grammarians in this forum can provide additional color.

  

Therefore, while Rama is related to रमण, I don't see evidence for its etymological relationship to "roam." Moreover, the theory of the migration and settlement of nomadic tribes in northern and Southern India is disputed. It may not be advisable to connect such a hypothesis with the story of Shri Rama but I understand that it has been done so by some in the past.  

  

Best,

Kushagra
