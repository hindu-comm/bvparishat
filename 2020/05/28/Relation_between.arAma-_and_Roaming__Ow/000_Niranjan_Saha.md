Dear List,

  

One of my old students who is teaching in a West Bengal (India) Government aided primary school has pointed out the following to me (I've also attached the screenshots sent by him, which are in Bengali script).

  

In a text book it's mentioned that the Sanskrit word 'Rﾄ［a' and the English one 'Roaming' have similarity in terms of their pronunciation and meaning, as 'Rﾄ［a'means 'roamer' (i.e. a person who roams), and thatRﾄ［a is a hero in the Ramayana which refers to the fact that a group of nomads, while roaming, entered the Indian subcontinent and settled in the southern part of India after being settled in the northern part of India.

  

I'd appreciate to know if the word 'Rﾄ［a' bears any such meaning etymologically.

  

Sorry for cross posting.

  

  

With regards,

Niranjan
