Dear scholars,

Digital version of the following work is now available.

Gaṇitanāmamālā of Haradatta

  

<https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/ganitanamamala_haradatta/orig/ganitanamamala.txt>

  

N.B. - The printed version has a lot of grammatical errors apparent on face of it. Therefore, the confidence level for editing digitized version is also quite low.  

--  

Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S

Collector and District Magistrate, Surat
