Goodman, C., Schultz, A. Prajñākaramati on Śāntideva’s Case Against Anger: A Translation of*Bodhicaryāvatāra-pañjikā*VI.1-69.*J Indian Philos*(2020). <https://doi.org/10.1007/s10781-020-09429-y>  

  

Abstract:

"A translation of a major part of Prajñākaramati’s canonical commentary on the Perfection of Patient Endurance chapter of Śāntideva’s*Bodhicaryāvatāra*. The introduction clarifies the importance of the commentary and explores what can be learned from it. Prajñākaramati’s comments help illuminate the meaning of the verses and provide evidence for the view that the*Bodhicaryāvatāra*should be understood as offering not just meditation exercises, but also rational arguments that can be evaluated as philosophy."
