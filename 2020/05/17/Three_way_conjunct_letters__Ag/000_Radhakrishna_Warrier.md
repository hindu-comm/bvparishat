After the Malayalam script reform of the 1970’s and 1980’s, the print media started simplifying some three-way conjunct letters to just two-way. For example:

Addhyāpakaṉ (അദ്ധ്യാപകൻ = teacher) to Adhyāpakaṉ (അധ്യാപകൻ)

Vidyārtthi (വിദ്യാർത്ഥി) to vidyārthi (വിദ്യാർഥി)

Sūryyaṉ (=sun) as sūryaṉ.

In the case of sūryaṉ and vidyārthi, they also did away with the ardha repha symbol above the consonant (a very small vertical line).

I haven’t seen in Devanagari the forms like अद्ध्यापक, विद्यार्त्थीor सूर्य्य, but other regional language scripts might be using such forms. Did they ever undergo a “script reform” and did they also discard these old forms among other changes?
