Even after the script reform recommendations, many people continue to use reduplication. I think the re-duplicated form is more prevalent than the non-reduplicated form in the case of rddha, rttha, ddhya and tthya.

  

Does Panini speak only about r and h? What is Panini's rule in the case of   अध्यापक Vs अद्ध्यापक (adhyaapaka Vs addhyaapaka)?  Even though the script reformers of Malayalam preferred people to write അധ്യാപക (adhyaapaka) most people continued to write as അദ്ധ്യാപക (addhyaapaka) adhering to tradition.

  

However, forms with duplication of 'm' as in Varmma or Nirmmala are now declining in Malayalam. Forms with ryya have completely disappeared with the disappearance of the half repha ligature (a short vertical line over the consonant) and the rya form is exclusively used in print.

Radhakrishna Warrier
