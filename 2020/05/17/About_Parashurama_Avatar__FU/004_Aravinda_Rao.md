Namaskars,

I think Valmiki has not portrayed Parasurama**as an *avatar* of Vishnu, though some *purana*-s have claimed so. The traditional commentators Govindaraja and others have pointed out the *puranic* version too and said that the visit of *PR* was intended to transfer Vishnu’s energy and glory from *PR* to Rama. This looks fine but Valmiki is silent on this.

The introduction of Parasurama in the Ramayana is dramatic. While the marriage party was returning, a huge wind storm arose, encompassing the sky with darkness and uprooting the trees. The sun was enveloped in a cloud. From such cloud emerged Parasurama with a battle axe on one shoulder and a huge bow on the other. The sages recognized him and offered due respects. He merely acknowledged them and spoke straight to Rama. “I have heard of your wonderful powers and about breaking of bow. Here is another bow (the bow of Vishnu), equally strong. Brace this string and pull the bow, if you can. I will grant you a duel.”

Dasaratha was petrified by such challenge and tried to plead in an entreating manner but Parasurama ignored him totally and continued to address Rama. He narrated the history of the bow. He told how the bow was originally equal in strength to the other bow (broken by Rama). Gods were curious to know whether Vishnu was greater or Shiva was greater. They caused a fight between Shiva and Vishnu in which Shiva’s bow was rendered feeble by Vishnu. Gods thought that Vishnu was greater. Later the bow came down to Jamadagni, the father of Parasurama. Parasurama also told how his father Jamadagni was wrongly killed by a king named Kartavirya and how he took revenge on him by killing him and also eliminating his whole clan. Having spoken haughtily, he challenged Rama to pick up the bow.

Rama accepted the challenge but he was gentle and respectful in his words, partly due to the presence of his father and partly due to respect towards a Brahmin. He took the bow, braced the string, fixed the shaft and also pulled the bow. He addressed Parasurama - “Out of respect for you I do not wish to take your life. The shaft of Vishnu’s bow cannot go waste. I can either impair you by hitting your ability to fly or alternatively hit the heavenly worlds achieved by you by your austerities.” *PR* realized that Rama was Vishnu himself and acknowledged as such. He chose to forego the heavenly worlds achieved by him. Rama accordingly released the shaft and destroyed the worlds.

Valmiki’s words are very significant here. He says “*jagāma-ātma-gatiṃ* *prabhuḥ*” (1-77-24). Literally it means that he went in his own way. This would be a pale interpretation, knowing the nature of Valmiki. Probably a Vedantic understanding is intended by him. *PR* has merely earned the heavenly worlds which are inferior in nature compared to the knowledge of self. The Isavasya Upanishad declares – “The slayers of atman do attain the worlds which are demonic, after all (Isa-3)”. A seeker of self-knowledge does not aim to achieve such worlds. Self-realization is the highest goal as per Vedanta. Valmiki probably conveys this message in a subtle way when he mentions in that *PR* departs for *ātma-gati* (1-77-24). The word ‘*gati*’ is also indicative of knowledge, as per the Vedanta tradition. Rama did not hit the ‘*gati’* of *PR* but merely destroyed the worlds. It is a clear message that one should aspire for self-knowledge. What *PR* does here is precisely the same. We shall see later in the Ramayana that two sages offer the heavenly worlds attained by them to Rama, but he politely declines. From all this, Parasurama seems to have been portrayed as a mighty sage who had attained heavenly worlds with his tapas.
