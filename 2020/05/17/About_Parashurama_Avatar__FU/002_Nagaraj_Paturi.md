The descriptions on various narrations indicate that the darpa does not belong to the Vishnu ams'a that was possessed by the Rishi. It belonged to the Rishi who was possessed by Vishnu ams'a. In the garvabhanga episode, what happens is Vishnu taking back his ams'a and the Rishi moving back to his humble form which he had prior to the possession by the ams'a.
