Since Shri Subrahmanian Ji mentioned this in the context of Tulsidas, I re-read the relevant portion of his Balakanda and noted the following instances where Shri Parashurama could be attributed with arrogance.

  

1\. The first instance simply calls him a “proud warrior.”

2\. The second one states that Shri Parashurama excelled at singing his own praises.

3\. The third one is a general admonishment from Lakshmana stating that only a coward recounts his valor when faced with an imminent battlefield.

  

All three appear to be reasonably innocuous and could be explained by invoking the Bhagawan’s leela on earth:

  

**बिहसि लखनु बोले मृदु बानी।  
अहो मुनीसु महा भटमानी॥**

**  
**

**लखन कहेउ मुनि सुजसु तुम्हारा।  
तुम्हहि अछत को बरनै पारा॥  
अपने मुँह तुम्ह आपनि करनी।  
बार अनेक भाँति बहु बरनी॥**

**  
**

**सूर समर करनी करहिं कहि न जनावहिं आपु।  
बिद्यमान रन पाइ रिपुकायर कथहिं प्रतापु॥  
**

  

However, it’s certainly true that the Namaramayanam and perhaps other summaries use the word “darpa.”
