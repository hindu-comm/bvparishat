I think following from Ramcharitmanas brings out Sage Parasuram's glorious aspect:

He then recognized Rama's glory and his whole frame was thrilled with joy and his  
hair stood on end. Folding his hands in salutation he addressed the following words to  
Råma, his heart overflowing with emotion:  
(284)  
  
Glory to Råma, who delights Raghμuís race even as the sun delights a cluster of  
lotuses! Glory to the One that like fire consumes the forest of the demon race! Glory to the  
Benefactor of gods, Bråhmaƒas and cows! Glory to Him who takes away pride, ignorance,  
passion and delusion!  
(1)  
  
  
Glory to Him who is an ocean of humility, amiability, compassion and goodness and  
a pastmaster in the art of speech. Glory to the Delighter of His servants and to Him who is  
graceful of every limb and whose form possesses the beauty of millions of Cupids! (2)  
  
How can I with one tongue expatiate on Your glories? Glory to Him who sports in  
the mind of the great Lord Shiva as a swan in the Månasarovara lake! In my ignorance I have  
said much that was unseemly; therefore, pardon me, both the brothers, embodiments of  
forgiveness that You are.
