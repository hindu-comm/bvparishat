Dear Mr. Subrahmanian,

  

The verse in the Ramayana marking the celebrated transition from Shri Parashurama to Shri Rama is the following:

  

जडीकृते तदा लोके रामे वरधनुर्द्धरे ।  
निर्वीर्यो जामदग्न्योऽसौ रामो राममुदैक्षत ।। 1.76.11 ।।

  

To which the commentator Govindaraja adds:

  

निर्वीर्यः निर्गतवैष्णवतेजाः। तथा च पुराणान्तरम्-- "ततः परशुरामस्य देहान्निर्गत्य वैष्णवम् । पश्यतां सर्वदेवानां तेजो राममुपाविशत् ।।  

  

The verse quoted by the commentator indicating the transition is said to be from the Narasimha Purana (not independently verified). After this, Shri Parashurama ceased to be an avatara of Vishnu.

  

At the moment, I do not recall a verse indicating that Shri Parashurama suffered from darpa. There are certainly many references to his fury in the Puranic literature. Indeed, the same verse (16.4) from the Bhagawad Gita that lists darpa as an Aasuri Sampada also lists krodha:

  

दम्भो दर्पोऽभिमानश्च क्रोधः पारुष्यमेव च।  
अज्ञानं चाभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम्।।16.4।।  

  

However, I do not see anger as a special defect of Shri Parashurama, since Shri Rama and Shri Krishna are also said to be angry at various times. For instance, from the Ramayana: इत्युक्त्वा राघवः क्रुद्धो.

  

Therefore, the broader question would be: can an avatara display any negative qualities, including anger? The answer, in my view, has to be yes, given the above instances.
