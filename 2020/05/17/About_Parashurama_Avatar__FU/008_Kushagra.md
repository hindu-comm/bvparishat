Subrahmanian Ji,

  

That characterization could be a bit unfair because the Parashurama story is related in greater detail in the Mahabharata and other Puranas. These accounts also highlight his many Bhagawan-like virtues.

  

I think our present concept of Bhagawan or Avatar is influenced by the idea of Pushti Avataras propounded by Swami Vallabhacharya. These are the four Avataras of Vishnu (Rama, Krishna, Nrisimha, and Vamana) that have been accorded prominence for the seekers of Bhakti.

  

Kushagra
