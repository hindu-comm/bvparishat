Sometimes humorous situations can arise owing to confusion

\- and not only during transcription, but even when composing for print.

A legible handwriting is indeed to be treasured in manuscripts.  

  

We all know what a meticulous scholar Yudhishthir Mimamsak ji was.

His books are largely free from errors.

Yet here and there there are misprints, exceptionally.

  

I spotted one in a place least expected - in a header.

And a harmless one, to be sure.

It is one of the very orthographic confusions listed above.

The header reads : *pANinIya-sUtra-pATha.*

And we have *makAra* in place of *sakAra* !
