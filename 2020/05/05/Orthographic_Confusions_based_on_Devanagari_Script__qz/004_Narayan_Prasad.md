\<\<Prof. TN Srikantaiah was a giant of a scholar.He is famed for a book of his on Indian poetics.If a student of Indian poetics has not read this book,he has indeed missed something vital.To read the original in Kannada is a feast.\>\>

  

BTW, what is the title of the book in Kannada?

I have read only his book/article on Kannada grammar.

Kannada poetics and prosody I have seen only those edited by F. Kittel.

  

Thanks and regards

Narayan Prasad
