Dear Kannan Sir,

  

I am so happy that you have introduced Prof. T. N. ShreekanThayya and his Magnumopus to BVP.

  

Yes, as you rightly mentioned, he was not a product of "traditional" system of learning. But he was a worthy student of Prof. M. Hiriyanna and DVG, the doyen of Kannada literature has mentioned that "Not all BAs and MAs are TNS and DLN (D. L. Narasimhaachaarya, another great scholar in classical Kannada). "

  

It is so unfortunate that in the recent years his book is demeaned by the so called champions of Kannada who fight for its exclusivity.

  

With warm regards

Ganesh
