Yes, the *Kannada Madhyama Vyakarana* is

an unsurpassed book of his.

  

Actually, should scholars from other departments of Sanskrit

follow the scheme and structure of his *Bharatiya Kavya Mimamse,*

it will make people love each *shAstra*.

  

Such books are needed for every shAstra in every language of India

(and even in English, of course).

  

BTW, it is to be noted that he came in the BA-MA-stream,

not any *pAThashAla* stream. Yet one can only marvel at  

the hold he had over poetics, and the felicity of expression  

needed for expounding a *shAstra* in almost a conversational style,  

but *without compromising on the rigour* even a bit.
