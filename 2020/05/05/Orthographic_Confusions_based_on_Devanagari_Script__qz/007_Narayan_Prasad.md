\<\<The header reads :*pANinIya-sUtra-pATha.*And we have*makAra*in place of*sakAra*!\>\>

  

Interesting.

Could you give a scanned version of this page?

  

In one advertisement in a magazine in place of the word "रियायत", by mistake "रियासत" was printed:

  

"20 सितम्बर तक यह इंजन खरीदने वाले को **रियासत** दी जायगी।"

  

The corresponding scanned page is attached.

Both the publisher and the advertiser were in awkward situation.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
