This is also the occasion to speak about printing errors.

Prof. TN Srikantaiah was a giant of a scholar.

He is famed for a book of his on Indian poetics.

So much so that his book has been translated into English

and published by Sahitya Academy.

If a student of Indian poetics has not read this book,

he has indeed missed something vital.

To read the original in Kannada is a feast.

  

He was also a very careful scholar.

He would not brook a single printer's error in his writings.

Once he spotted an error after the book was out.

It pained him so much that he skipped food for three days,

deeply depressed as he was.

  

And the misprint? Not indeed a terrible one:  

the word *prashamse* (meaning praise) was

printed as *prashamshe*.

  

How we wish our authors get as careful and concerned in what they write!

Leave alone errors in handwriting where the vagaries can be unpredictable.

Even while typing a four-liner to BVP,

they will not have just checked once whether what they typed is error-free.

  

This apart, it is generally accepted that whatever we write must be revised.

And revised multiple times. The maxim is :  

With every revision, the quality of the writing goes up by 20%.
