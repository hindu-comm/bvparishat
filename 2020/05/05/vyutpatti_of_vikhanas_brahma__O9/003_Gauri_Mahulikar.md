Hari Om!

Since this is a thread of etymology, I would like to know more about a few names of Indra given in Amarakosha

लेखर्षभः -लेखेषु वृषभः\| Indra is the best, mighty in लेख, What does it mean? Does it refer to Indra digging out the course of rivers? (3.33)

ऋभुक्षाः - ऋभुषु, विद्वत्सु क्षयतीति। Is this associated with the Vedic deity ऋभु

I urge the scholars to enlighten me

  

warm regards
