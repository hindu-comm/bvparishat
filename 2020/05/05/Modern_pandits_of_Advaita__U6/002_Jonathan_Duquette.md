Dear all,

  

More specifically, I am thinking of:

  

a\. literally *any* work by Tyāgarāja Śāstri, except for the *Sadvidyāvilāsa.* I am especially interested in a reported controversy between him and Rāmasubrahmaṇya Śāstri in the context of the latter's composition of the *Mahāśaivamatamardana* (which I have).

b\. From Rāmasubrahmaṇya Śāstri: *Bhāṣyatātparyasaṃgraha*, *Brahmasūtratattvavilāsa*, *Sarvavedāntasarvamatatattvārthavilāsa*;

c\. From Tryambaka Śāstri, especially the *Bhāṣyabhānuprabhā*.

  

Thank you for any help!  

  

Jonathan
