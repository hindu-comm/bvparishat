Dear all,

  

I am interested in acquiring works written by modern pandits of Advaita, including (among others) Tyagarāja Makhin, Rāmasubha Śāstrin, Tryambaka Śāstrin and others of the same period. I would be truly grateful for any scans/pdfs of their works (I am happy to exchange what I already have) or get guidance as to where I could find their works. I have got everything that is available on Archives.org. So I am looking for material that some of you may have gathered on the way.

  

Thank you for any help!

  

Jonathan
