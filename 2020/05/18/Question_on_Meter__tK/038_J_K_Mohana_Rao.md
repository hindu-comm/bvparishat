Interestingly, puShpitAgrA and aparavaktrA seem to be the only special cases of vaitALIya set, namedin nATyaSAstra and pingaLa Chandas.

mAlabhAriNi of the aupachChandasika group was named in rantnamanjUSha of unknown authorship (probably of seventh century). This metre was used by aSvaghOSha as well as Sankara.

viyOginI was not named in any of the earlier lakshaNa granthas. But it was used in charakasaMhita and also aSvaghOSha (about 100 200 AD), kAlidAsa in KS.

It was named much later by jayakIrti and hEmachandra as well as in vRittaratnAkara. In fact the name vibodhitA used by jayakIrti comes straight from the first poem of canto IV of KS. The name viyOgini was first used in mandAramaranda.
