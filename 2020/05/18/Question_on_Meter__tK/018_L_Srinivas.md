\> \> I'm sure Kalidasa never wrote verses like this  
  

\> The actual metrical practice of Sanskrit kavis is depicted in the article by H.D. Velankar attached here ("The Prosodical  

\> Practice of Sanskrit Poets", in: *Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society*, (New Series), vol. 24-25 \[1948-49\],  

\> pp. 49-92).

  

Yes but Kalidasa never wrote verses with such assonances as I had indicated. Check for example Kumarasambhavam Sarga 4.
