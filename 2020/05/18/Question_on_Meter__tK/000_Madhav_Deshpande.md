At the beginning of his commentary on the Raghuvaṃsa, Mallinātha's 3rd verse reads:

  

शरणं करवाणि शर्मदं ते

चरणंवाणि चराचरोपजीव्यम् ।

करुणामसृणै: कटाक्षपातै:

कुरुमामम्ब कृतार्थसार्थवाहम् ।।

  

The verse has 11 syllables in the first and the third pādas and 12 in the 2nd and the 4th pādas. I have known this verse since my childhood and have been reciting it as part of a daily Sarasvatī prayer. However, I have not been able to identify its meter. Would appreciate any help inthis matter. Thanks.
