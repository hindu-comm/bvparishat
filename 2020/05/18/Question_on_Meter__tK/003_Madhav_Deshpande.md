Thank you both Professor Kannan and Roland Steiner. I don't know why I could not think of this. For some reason, I did not think of this as a mātrāvr̥tta and kept on checking Apte'slist of other meters. Now I see that Apte has listed the Aupacchandasika at the end of all mātrāvr̥ttas as a variety of Vaitālīya. The BVP shines!
