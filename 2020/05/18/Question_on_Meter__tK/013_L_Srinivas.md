Interestingly, this verse displays all the characteristics of traditional south Indian (e.g., Tamil) poetry. It has dvitīyākṣara prāsam (etukai in Tamil) and it has perfect in-line assonance (called mōnai in Tamil) between the first and third feet (ś-ś, c-c, k-k, k-k) in all the 4 lines.  

  

In addition, by merely inserting a svarabhakti vowel in 'śarmadaṁ', it shows up as 100% compliant with a traditional Tamil meter called 'kali viruttam'. I'm sure Kalidasa never wrote verses like this.
