Dear Dr. Mansukh Moliya Ji,

If one takes this definition of the ‘aupacchandasika’—

1st and 3rd pāda: six ‘mātrā’s + ra + ya

2nd and 4th pāda: eight ‘mātrā’s + ra + ya

then I think the number of variations/forms of the metre are 1,95,364 and not 10,816. This is how I arrived at the number

1\) Number of combinations of ‘laghu’ and ‘guru’ which add up to six ‘mātrā’s = the seventh Fibonacci number (F7) = 13. These are ऽऽऽ, ऽऽ।।, ।ऽऽ।, ।।ऽऽ, ऽ।ऽ।, ।ऽ।ऽ, ऽ।।ऽ, ।।।।ऽ, ।।।ऽ।, ।।ऽ।।, ।ऽ।।।, ऽ।।।।, and ।।।।।।.

2\) Number of combinations of ‘laghu’ and ‘guru’ which add up to eight ‘mātrā’s = the ninth Fibonacci number (F9) = 34. These can be similarly listed as above.

So, with 13 possible patterns for first quarter and third quarter each and 34 possible patterns for second quarter and fourth quarter each, the number of forms/variations of the ‘aupacchandasika’ would be 1,95,364 (13 × 34 × 13 × 34). This is much higher than your number 10,816.



If one takes Dr. Steiner’s definition

1st and 3rd pāda: 3 × 2 ‘mātrā’s + ra + ya

2nd and 4th pāda: 4 × 2 ‘mātrā’s + ra + ya

Then the number of forms is (F4 × F4) × (F5 × F5) × (F4 × F4) × (F5 × F5) = (3 × 3) × (5 × 5) × (3 × 3) × (5 × 5) = 50,625. This number is also much higher than the number 10,816 that you have.



Perhaps 10,816 is the number arrived at with some additional constraints? Could you please cite the source and the constraints listed?

Thanks,

Nityānanda
