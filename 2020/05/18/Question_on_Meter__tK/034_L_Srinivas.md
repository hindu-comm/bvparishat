No problem. I do have no intention of holding up a light to burqa clad men whose burqas seem to lack even the see through piece over the eyes!  

  

People, least of all professors, ought to read posts more carefully. They can also read Svati Tirunal on the subject whose elegant Sanskrit is a pleasure to read.  

  

Hope this helps,

  
Srini
