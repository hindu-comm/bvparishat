Yes. *  
*

*Vaitālīya* has  

10, 11, 10, 11.

This one (which I had myself identified earlier as *Aupacchandasika*) has

11, 12, 11, 12.

(The last syllable has, of course, the freedom to be *laghu* or *guru*.)

Adding just one syllable (each quarter) thus to *Vaitālīya*,

this metre is obtained.

(*Aparavaktra* also called *Vaitālīya* sometimes: p. 23).
