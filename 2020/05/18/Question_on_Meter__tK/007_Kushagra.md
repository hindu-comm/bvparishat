Dear Professor Deshpande,

  

It is available publicly and is easy to use. However, the website says that it is still undergoing testing.

  

<http://1e.sanskritmetres.appspot.com/>

  

I have personally tested it on many different meters over the last year and haven’t found a single error.

  

Thanks,

Kushagra
