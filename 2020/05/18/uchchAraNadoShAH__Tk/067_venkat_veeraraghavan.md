Dear Sri Ramakrishnan

  

Thank you so much for clarifying this issue.

Thanks also Shri Warrier ji for his explanation.

  

I must admit that i am sadly lacking in a classical Tamil education and hence a victim of dravidian propaganda and took to heart what that clown Kamalhassan said about these 'mispronunciations ' in an interview long back.

And i will also know better than to hold up the current stateof Tamil as representative of what the original grammarians intended.

  

Thank you again.

  

I learnt something today!

It is also gratifying to know MS amma was right. Better her than I.

  

Regards

Venkat
