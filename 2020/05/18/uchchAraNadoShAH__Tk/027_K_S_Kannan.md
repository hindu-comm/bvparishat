Rather than remain as mute witnesses to the language "deterioration" happening

in terms of loss of sounds/scripts, or mix-ups and mispronunciations,  

institutions for language studies like CIIL,Mysore/RSS, Delhi/others

should take up projects to cover the entire spectrum of Indian pronunciation

covering all languages/dialects etc., and more importantly,

disseminating this knowledge through on-line media

so that anybody can watch anytime and learn.
