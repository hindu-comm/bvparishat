Dear Smt Irene ji

  

" You see, two centuries of forced servitude would potentially account for inertia, but what about destructive initiative?"

  

There is a fair amount of that (destructive initiative). As Dr. Kannan has pointed out the leftists have had a strangelholdon the humanities and SS sections.

And I am sure you have heard of the term more royalist than the queen/king?

That is lefties and the Congress for you.

Sense of any sort farless the common variety is unlikely to prevail.  

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
