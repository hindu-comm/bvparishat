Dear Vishvas Ji,

  

  Thanks for these Purāṇa references. They show a wide awareness of this phenomenon among the Veda Śākhās, their regionalization and the possible influence of local languages on the pronunciation of the reciters. One should be aware of this, but I believe that it is in some sense unavoidable. I have noticed this in the US, where the Indian American children born and brought up in the environment of American English pronounce their Indian names that are sometimes incomprehensible to the first generation immigrants like me. We were at a store where the salesperson was a young Indian American man. I asked him what his name was, and he said it was वीकस्. That didn't make any sense to me, so he showed me his badge where the name was given in English as "Vikas". I would have expected him to pronounce it as "vikās", but for him his name was "vīkas." My grand-daughter's name is Meghna (मेघना), but she cannot pronounce घ, and so she and her American classmatespronounceher name as मेग्ना. Of course, my American interlocutors cannot pronounce the difference between द and ड in my name देशपांडे, and my name is pronounced as a combination of English "dish-pan-day." That is the best approximation for an American English speaker.
