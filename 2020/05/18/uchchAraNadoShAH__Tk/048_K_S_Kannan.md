How can you blame Malayalam linguists

when Kannada linguists are eager and zealous to seize that title  

\- beating all rivals, for example, by claiming that  

the vowel R is a great burden to students,

and therefore must be stripped from the Kannada alphabets.

  

(Their argument is that its use is "only in Sanskrit words"

even though they use ***kR**Shi* regularly.

Poor fellows, they don't have a non-Sanskrit word for even the *varNa-mAlA*).

  

So intense is their hatred for Sanskrit,

and their frequent declaration, unprovoked, that Sanskrit is dead,

that Vidwan Ranganatha Sharma had to countertaunt them once with something like

"Is Kannada then a necrophage (=शव-भक्षक)?".

  

While recent Kannada dictionaries are trying to reduce Sanskrit words,

famous dictionaries have around 80% Sanskrit words.
