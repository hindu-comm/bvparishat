Dear Shri Paturi Garu:-

  

It is my frequent observation that institutions with widespread media coverage tend to be heard more than individuals. The govt is afterall there to be seen to be doing work.

  

It might be a good idea for you to buddy up with people like Dr. Kannan and use the entrepreneurial strategy of generating buzz:

1\. Publish Media like books / videos

2\. Editorials in papers (so that people have the awareness)

3\. Interviews

  

When you do the above 3 it generates its own synergistic critical mass of momentum that helps get the educationists in the governmenttake notice.

Unfortunately even for legitimate issues one has to "kick up a fuss" and generate hungama in order to get the people to take action.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
