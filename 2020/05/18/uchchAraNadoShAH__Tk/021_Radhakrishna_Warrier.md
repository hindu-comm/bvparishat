Yes, the first and the last in that list. However, these characters are not used in print now. These were discarded in the late 1800s, unfortunately. But these are very distinct sounds for the Malayali.
Mispronunciation of the dental n as alveolar or vice versa in Malayalam is immediately recognized by Malayali as a foreign accent. Same is the case with alveolar t.
