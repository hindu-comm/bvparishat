"How do you write alveolar ṯ and alveolar ṉ in maLayaLam script?"

  

Unvoiced alveolarṯ occurs only in the geminate (double) form and is represented as double hardṟṟ (റ്റ).

  

Eg:കാറ്റു് = kāṟṟŭ = kāṯṯŭ

  

Alveolar ṉ existed as a character distinct from dental n till about the second half of the 1800s, but was discarded under the logic that a Malayali can easily tell when to pronounce n as dental or as alveolar.
In my personal opinion, that was not a wise move, like the discarding of the samvrta ukaara in the 1970 - 1980 period.

Radhakrishna Warrier
