In the last interview he gave to a famous Kannada TVChannel,

Dr HMNayak (1931-2000), Professor, Mysore Uni.,

regretted two things in his life

\- that he did not learn Sanskrit, and

\- that he sought and fought to remove Sanskrit from the syllabus of Kannada MA.

The consequence of the accomplishment of the latter was that  

there were hardly any scholars left in the universities in Karnataka  

who could indeed properly read, much less teach, a haLagannaDa text!

  

Too late to regret!
