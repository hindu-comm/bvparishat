This is interesting Prof. Deshpande ji. I presume अणकार is a system of recital that avoids pronouncing ण andअषकार is a system of recital without pronouncingष.  How canण and ष be avoided in Sanskrit pronunciation when there are plenty of these sounds in Sanskrit? The very word Krishna has both these sounds. In place of ण and ष, what would they pronounce, n and s? And these debates happened in the ancient days ofAitareya Āraṇyaka?
