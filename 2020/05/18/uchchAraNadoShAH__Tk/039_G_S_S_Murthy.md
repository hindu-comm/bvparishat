As to mispronouncing TP Kailasam'sjoke takes the cake:

The railway Traffic Manager was travelling on the Hassan-Bangalore line in his saloon. The porter at Hassan was shouting "aasana,aasana". And he heard the porter at Arsikere shouting "harasikere, harasikere". The officer had a brain wave and issued transfer orders to the two porters; they would interchange their places of posting. In his next tour on the same line he was crestfallen to hear the new Arsikere porter shouting "Harasikere" and the new porter at Hassan shouting "Aasana, Aasana".

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
