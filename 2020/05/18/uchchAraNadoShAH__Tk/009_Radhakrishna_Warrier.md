This is also quite interesting. I have noticed this with 2nd generation Indians in Canada and the US. My 3 and a half year old grandson speaks three languages,  his mother's language Kannada, his father's language Malayalam, and English that he uses at his daycare in eastern Canada.
He pronounces Kannada and Malayalam words in the normal way but when he introduces English words in these languages, he pronounces these words exactly as the native English speakers would. When he says "car" he says khāẓ (ẓ ഴ ழ is a glide), and not kār with an unaspirated ‘k’ in the beginning and a trilling r at the end as most first generation Indians would say.  But interestingly he still maintains the correct accent when speaking Kannada or Malayalam. He says“maṇṇu” (soil) when speaking to his mother but changes it to “maṇṇŭ” (with a samvṛta ukāra at the end) when speaking to his father. He used to speak four languages, including French, when his parents lived in Montreal. After they relocated to eastern Canada, he forgot French.
