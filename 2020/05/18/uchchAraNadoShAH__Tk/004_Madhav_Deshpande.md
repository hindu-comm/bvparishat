To add a footnote to the comprehensive references given by Professor Korada, I would like to mention that there is a specific text called Dantyoṣṭhyavidhi to teach the distinction between व and ब, as these were confusing to some reciter, perhaps in Eastern India. The three volumes of Vedic Variants noted by Franklin Edgerton and Murray Emeneau amply attest to the variants found among the various Veda Śākhās, and some of these are probably attributable to regional variation in the pronunciation of Sanskrit. The Aitareya Āraṇyaka already records a debate on whether the Saṃhitā of the R̥gveda is अणकार and अषकार, or सणकार and सषकार, and concludes that the tradition represented by the author of this Āraṇyaka follows the lineage of Māṇḍūkeya, and that the Saṃhitā should be recitedसणकार and सषकार. But the discussion attests to the historical fact that some reciters were in favor of anअणकार and अषकार recitation of the R̥gveda.
