Dear Vidwans,

  

What is the use of fault finding? How far shikshas and pratishakhyas address the problem so that these mis-pronunciations can be remedied?

  

Imagine what would have happened if doctors would just have diagnosed a disease in a patient and were incapable of offering a remedy? People go to a doctor seeking remedy not merely a diagnosis.

  

However as far as defects of speech are concerned the patient does not realise he is sick and hence does not seek remedy. I think that is the reason why Patanjali says people utter words in order to convey meaning. He should have added, it is so because the speaker is not concerned/interested to know whether the intended message is passed or not.

  

Bhartruhari therefore says that the speaker and the listener are equal partners in a communication.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
