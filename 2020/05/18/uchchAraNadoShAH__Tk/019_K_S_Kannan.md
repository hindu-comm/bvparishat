This has some resemblance with the 6-Rupee episode cited by Prof. Deshpande.

Many Hindi-speaking people miss the short a in many long words

such as *rAja* pronounced as *rAj* under some circumstances.

  

Something similar led to a different interpretation altogether.

It was stated that kings have four eyes!

And why?

Because the statement that kings, said to have spies as their eyes,  

was now spoken of having four eyes. The problem was with  

pronouncing the middle word lopping off the a-ending:

*rAjAnaH cAra-cakShuShaH.*

*cAra* ("spy"), mixed up with *cAr* ("four" in Hindi)!
