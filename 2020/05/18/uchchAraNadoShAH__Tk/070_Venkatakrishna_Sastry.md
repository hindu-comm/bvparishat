Namaste



Clarification request for supplemental inforamtion on \< We did learn these nuances in high school Tamil grammar. \> ? 



What year of schooling? which area? What grammar resource used for reference beyond the claim ' My teacher said that this is the standard of X- langauge ( where X- is equally applicable to Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, …including english !) ?

Post Highschool, was there any check on which standards (beyond personal passion and liking ) were being referred by highschool teacher ?



A post period check would be : How are current X-language ( in this context,Tamil) schools teachers teaching basics of language pronunciation ?



Thanks in advance for the help.



Regards

BVK Sastry
