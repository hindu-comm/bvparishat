Perhaps he was talking about his drAviDa-kazhagam/Periyarist buddies, and probably 99% of them can't pronounce zha or La or likely even Na :-). Amusing story: A junior of mine in college went to high school in TUttukuDi. One of his classmates was the son of a DMK MLA and this boy knew NO Tamil. So when the late Mu Karunanidhi came once to their house he had a crash course for a few weeks on how to say a couple of sentences to him :-).
