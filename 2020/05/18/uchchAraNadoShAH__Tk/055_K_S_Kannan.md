The effect of the Leftist capturing of Humanities and Social Sciences  

in respect of framing of syllabi/appointment to high posts has been

that whoever has done BA ends up as an almost rabid hater  

of Sanskrit, of the Vedic, and in general, of the Indic heritage.

  

It was only those who took science/engineering/medicine

that could be expected to speak sense and be balanced.

  

And that is why the L-Gang spread its tentacles over many institutions of  

higher learning in science and engineering, virtually spoiling and vitiating  

the minds of the young and brilliant students there. Now we have harvest after harvest

of bright minds, a good many of whom have no sense of direction,

and look up exclusively to Western models for progress of whatever definition

in any direction whatsoever.
