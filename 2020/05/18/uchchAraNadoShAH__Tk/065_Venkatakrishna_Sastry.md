Namaste



1. The script reform approach of 1970 -to-1980 is a very narrow window to understand the decays that were already set in in the traditional Education system at India.

The ' historic narrative , useful for a good postmortem analysis can be seen in the 44 page report report available at the following link

<https://sg.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69112/5/chapter%203.pdf> .

Good people have advised in the past on what needs to have been done. The failure to implement the good advise, as ' Ravana , Dhrutarashtra' syndrome lies elsewhere. 

One can see this scenario for each of the indian languages; and focusing on Sanskrit, the failure to implement the three education commission reports so far.

What is happening at the current period in the name of ' pushng digital literacy' as New NAtional Education policy is struggle to fit an elephant to the pigeons hols :: Indic langague repertorie to fit on the given unicode framework and 'legacy encoding', which is on the exit mode in A.I for Human Langauge technologies framework.



2\. Knowledge of history is important to diagnose the malady. But
pushing ' hisotry to be the detiny of present endeavor' needs a justification by several factors, especialy the econmic factor.



 The 'makret for 'Moksha- Spiritual dimension of langauge -education offers ' is not same as ' 'Market-Social dimension of langauge -education offers accelearted through technology power'.



If 'we the langauge people' do think that the 'langauge standards of specific texts and resoruces' are of value, then we need to show the relevance of these studies ,today and for future.

We are not going to live in past. We just slide down time-line to
become 'past' , post our active life and life span.



The script reform committee used a specific reform under a social and technological constraint. And it was good for the literacy of the specific writing system. Scripts evovled ever since IVC to Ashokan to current period. But the voice of the sacred texts still remain the ancient one and standard.

The language user communities seem to have become insensivitie / developed new snsitivities in articulating the sounds of sacred texts; an inchecked unrestrained drift in slippage of ear-sensitivity to
language sounds and standards.

The missing dimension of 'Tradiitonal Langauge' is it connection to socio-economics of nation and relevance to ' techno-economics' due to ' langauge user community apathy.



3\. Cleaning up the three hundred years ' dust of langauge reform and social apathy' using a few millennia old texts for referencing and then aligning it to a alien language phonetic structure and standards --- There seems to be some thing misisng in the entire discourse here.



The human voice with all its potential, remains the same, waiting for any one to be discovered and used. This is Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya as 'Vak-Yoga' appraoch to study and experience. This pursuit to discover the potential of human speech is not constrained by langauge tag classifications and use in historic time. Langauge sound is a current moment and person specific reality. Script is only a pointer ( upalakshana, soochaka, shaakhaa -chandra nyaya).
