Oh God dont get me started on that!

  

I am sick of correcting people that it is airtel not yairtel

  

But ofcourse the problem is more serious when it comes to veda patha.

Maybe this is why loukika bhasha and the lack of awareness people have when using the same results in ruining veda adhyayana as well.

  

I heard somewhere people spend 12-13 hours per day being distracted and this makes them highly skilled in this field and ruins even what they take up as a discipline.

The only solution is to forcibly bring awareness back into every aspect of life and not just what we consider as "discipline"

This is where the yoga aspect of veda is completely ignored.
