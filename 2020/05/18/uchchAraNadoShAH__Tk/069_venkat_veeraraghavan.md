Actually KH was making fun of tam brahm Tamizh.

I remember him quoting words like shonnaa 'said' and so on.

Dravidian bastardisation of Tamizh is the stuff of legend else why would they prop up the siriaar who said Tamizh is the language of kaattumiraandis?

Confused sense is not very uncommon. As long as the target is tam brahms they'll align with anyone!
