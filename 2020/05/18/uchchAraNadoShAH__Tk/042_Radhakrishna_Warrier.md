I have never heard MS mispronouncing Sanskrit ś, ṣ and s (श, ष, स). It is a different matter when it comes to Tamil. Classical Tamil has only one character (ச) to represent c, ś and s and there is no ṣ in Tamil.
In the distant past, initial c was pronounced as c, and intervocalic c was pronounced either as ś or as s. Slowly, initial c also began to be pronounced as either ś or s. So, in Tamil, ś and s are allophones and I don’t think there is any right or wrong in pronouncing it either as ś or s. I suspect ś to be more ancient than the s pronunciation. Brahmins and “higher” castes normally use the ś pronunciation.  

Regarding the pronunciation of ē as yē, it seems to me that in modern Tamil, more than 90% people are unable to pronounce pure vowels e and o.
I hear most Tamils pronouncing the question word ēṉ (ஏன் = why) as yēṉ (யேன்). Same is the case with vowel ‘o’. Even the simple Om is pronounced like Wōm.



Some Kannadigas also do this. Erstwhile kings of Mysore, the Wodeyars are actually Odeyar (cognate with Malayalam / Tamil ഉടയർ / உடையர்). But most Kannadigas pronounce it as Wodeyar and spell in English as Wodeyar.
