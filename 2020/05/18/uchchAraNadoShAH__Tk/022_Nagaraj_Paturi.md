Thumb rule for script symbol formation for any language is

  

different script symbols for different phonemes meaning difference causing phones/sounds in that language

  

same script symbol for different mutual allophones.

  

If reason given for dropping a script symbol is that the speakers can know its pronunciation from the context, it means that those who dropped the symbol considered that the sound represented by the symbol is just an allophone of another phone/sound and not an independent phoneme.
