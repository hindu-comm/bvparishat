Dear Sri Venkat

  

Actually the late Srimati MSS is correct and pretty much right on the money. As per the nannUl, there are specific rules on how the ca-kAra should be pronounced. An old (free) translation of the nannUl can be found here<https://archive.org/details/atamilgrammarde00lazagoog/mode/2up>. The relevant sections are

One can argue how close to the Sanskrit sha-kAra the ca-kAra in tamil icai is, but it's certainly not isai. More "Brahmanical" accents use the Sanskrit sha very clearly, while purists may say it slightly different, but definitely not the Sanskrit sa-kAra. That sound is just not there in classical Tamil, although pretty much everyone uses it. We did learn these nuances in high school Tamil grammar.

  

The author has pointed out an equivalent Telugu alphabet, but I don't know Telugu to know what this means. An interesting note: my wife always says sharkara (similar to Tamil cakkarai), but means jaggery in Malayalam. I verified from her, they actually write the equivalent of the Sanskrit sha.
