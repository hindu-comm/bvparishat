\> It would be interesting to examine if meanings change in Vedic Sanskrit when dental sounds change to retroflex.  

  

------ if two phones (sounds in their minimum form) cause two different meanings, what you say by saying "meanings change" , then such meaning changing phonetic difference is called phonemic difference. The two meaningwise significant /distinct phones are called phonemes.

  

So your question, in technical language translates as

  

" are dental and retroflex versions of a consonant are allophones of each other or two different phonemes in Sanskrit?"

  

To decide this, one of the methods used is minimal pairs.

  

Pairs like

  

ततः, तटः

अष्ट , अस्त

  

mentioned by Sri Shashi Jshi-ji are called minimal pairs. They are called so because members of each pair differ only in one phone. Because the meanings of the two members of the pair are different, the difference causing phones in the pair are decided as two different phonemes in the language. For example,

ततः, तटः

अष्ट , अस्त

help to know that

  

त्, ट् are two different phonemes in Sanskrit.
