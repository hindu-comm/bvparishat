  From my information based on secondary sources, Indo-Aryan in the north-eastern parts of India don't have true retroflexes, and so Sanskrit retroflexes get pronounced as alveolars, and that reduces the distance betweenhen these sounds and dentals, and that increases the chances of dental/alveolar variation. Perhaps, Bijoy Ji or someone knows more details of this phenomenon. Marathi has generally lost the distinction between श/ष, and this survives only in written form, and in the pronunciation of an exceptionally few careful people.

  I remember an incident from my student days in Philadelphia. An American classmate of mine was telling me that he found a goddess murti in the museum and this is the goddess of six rupees. I was wondering what this goddess of six rupees could be. He showed me the inscription on the murti, and it said शतरूपा देवी. My American friend had difficulty orally distinguishing between षट्, शत, and रूप at first instinct became "rupees."

  The same thing happened at a meeting of the American Oriental Society. A scholar of Buddhism, David Seyfort Ruegg, was reading a paper on the Buddhist notion of तथता. In his pronunciation, the distinction of त and थ was lost and both became "t" in American English. So, every sentence he was reading became "tatata." I remember that Professor Cardona, who was sitting next to me, was so irritated at this that he told me: "If he says "tatata" once more, I am going to get up and leave." With the next utterance of "tatata," Cardona got up and left the room.

  Best,
