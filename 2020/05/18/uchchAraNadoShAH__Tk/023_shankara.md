Namaste,  
  

Once while I was traveling by train from Kerala to Mumbai, a passenger who knew only Tamil, asked me what is 'cold water' called in Hindi. I told him it is ठण्डा पानी.  

  

He was surprised, 'It is our name of our God'. I too was surprised to hear this. When I asked him which God, he said 'Murugan'. To his ears ठण्डा पानी was same as दण्डपाणी.

  

regards  
shankara
