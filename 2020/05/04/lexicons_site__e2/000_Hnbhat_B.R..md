I was frequently referring to search many books online in a site of lexicons inluding Puranic Encylopedia, Puranik Kosh, Vedic names Kridantaratnamala, and many Sanskrit English and sanskrit dictionarie, Vacaspatyam, and Shabdakalpadrum only few names I remember. It belonged to some university, but I forgot the address of the site and even the of the site.

  

I shall be obliged if any one can send me the link to the site.

  

Thanking You
