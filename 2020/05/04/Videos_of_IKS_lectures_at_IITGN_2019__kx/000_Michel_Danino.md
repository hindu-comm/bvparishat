Dear scholars,

We are working to transcribe all lectures in the earlier editions of the same course, with the intention of eventually publishing sourcebooks in IKS. More details on the course’s website: <http://iks.iitgn.ac.in/>.

Please forward the above link to anyone interested in ancient Indian technologies, a theme we hope to explore further in a future edition of the course.
