Namaste scholars,

  

I have been running small groups for our languages and trying to contribute my bit towards making the youth aware of the treasures we have.

  

I keep on referring to [archives.org](http://archives.org) for many things. But many times, it turns out to be of little use for simpler things. I am stuck at the point of what is barahakhadi in Samskrt and other Indic languages and how it is taught?

  

I shall be grateful if anybody could help me with this query or suggest some (links to the) book(s) regarding the same.

  

Wishing you a good day!

:)
