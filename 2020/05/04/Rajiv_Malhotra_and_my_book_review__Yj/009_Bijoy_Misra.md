Thank you Megh for your two links.  

I read the comments by McComas Taylor about Rajiv Malhotra's talk in World Sasnkrit Conference at Bangkok in 2015.

I was present in that talk. It did appear to me then that Malhotra's presentation had a political tone and was not appropriate  

as the plenary entry in an international scholars' assembly. The talk before him by John Brockington also carried political  

overtones, but not as severe.  

  

But Rajiv Malhotra has an overall point that many of the new western scholars are not analytic in literature and feed material

to some assumed constituency. I did sense that through the video clip in the second link. Dr Taylor has little to do

with the poetry, the lyricism and the storytelling of Valmiki's epic, or the language for that matter. He makes up a phrase like  

"slept with" as a sensationalist political commentator. Some of these young scholars wish to derive sociology in old India not  

by analyzing the literature but by picking up stories from some half-baked translations. In some sense, it is institutionalized

by a few older "scholars".  

  

I don't understand why the Sanskrit Conference takes political positions. I heard the Vancouver conference had some

women featured with complaints about privileges. Literature as sociology is not a research on the analysis of the fundamentals

of the language. The latter is hard and people get into easy journalist research. It is a fashion in the west to study India for

sociology, As I see in some posts in BVP, there is an element of frozen view in various quarters, which has to change to

analytic view for the sake of the language and the tradition.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
