Your point can be well taken, Sri Achyut-ji.

  

\>The question why do I need to learn Sanskrit needs an answer.  

  

Bhartrihari gives his arguments for why learning /speaking Sanskrit bestows or helps acquire the the culture of the s'ishṭas from whom Sanskrit evolved and is inherited.

  

But it is a digression from the point in the book and the author on hand.
