Friends,

  

My personal conversion to Indian studies has a lot to do with my meeting

Rajiv Malhotra in Harvard in 2001. He had instituted a visiting professor

position in the University through his Infinity Foundation. I also met

Prof Ashok Aklujkar during the time. Prof Aklujkar was the first occupant

of the position. He was followed by Prof Aravind Sharma. The arrangement

died after 2002.

  

I tallied with Rajiv Malhotra's observation that India was being distorted in

the foreign lands. I had noticed the superficiality of Indian studies through

my interaction with the curriculum (my daughter was an early undergraduate  

student). I created book reviews of Malhotra's books to help public understand.

I might have done reviews of three different books. This morning I saw my review  

of his book "Indra's Net" having been reproduced in JSTOR. I am sharing.

<https://www.jstor.org/stable/48505445?read-now=1&seq=1> This was 2014.  

  

I might have a review of one of his earlier books "Being Different". I had liked it.

I will post the review if I find it.

  

I thought to share this with a personal recollection.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
