Dear Paturiji,

  

Thanks for your response tomy mail.

  

With all respect to Sanskrit luminaries both present and past from where does authority come down?

  

From University degrees or from तप?

  

Does the modern concept of peer acceptance have any scientific basis?
Can opinions constitute शास्त्र?

  

What I wish to know is what makes Sanskrit such a unique language apart from all other languages? Is it the literature that it holds or the प्रयोग ?

  

There are some on this list who hold the view that Sanskrit is no different from any other world language. It is thus obvious that once the translations of its literature are made available there is no need for anyone to learn Sanskrit.

  

On the other hand if one holds an opposite view it is necessary for the protagonists of Sanskrit to enumerate the reasons thereof.

  

The question why do I need to learn Sanskrit needs an answer.

  

Is there any book which structurally compares Sanskrit with other languages both modern and ancient at the letter, word and senene level?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
