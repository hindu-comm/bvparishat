Sri Achyut-ji,

  

No one has claimed or advocated for 'saving' Sanskrit.

  

If your reference is to the book " The Battle for Sanskrit " , you will do well to read the book and know the content and enter the discussion based on your understanding of the book.

  

The book does not talk about *saving* Sanskrit at all.

  

The book is about 'Sanskrit Studies ' not about Sanskrit.

  

Even with regard to Sanskrit Studies, it does not talk about saving Sanskrit Studies.

  

It talks about the question of *authority* in Sanskrit Studies. It deals with the question of who is to be taken as the authority for Sanskrit Studies, who is presently being taken as the authority for Sanskrit Studies.

  

He argues that traditional Indian scholars or Indian Sanskrit scholars with the traditional / insider's understanding are the right authority for Sanskrit Studies. But not taking active and/or leadership role in that area, they allowed outsiders without any traditional / insider's understanding or empathy for traditional /insider's understanding and more , not just apathy but even antipathy for traditional/insider's understanding to assume authority for Sanskrit Studies. He pleads /advocates for traditional Indian scholars or Indian Sanskrit scholars with the traditional / insider's understanding to reclaim that authority.

  

For that matter, the book argues that there is no need of saving Sanskrit by arguing that the thesis of Death of Sanskrit is an invalid thesis.

  

You are or anyone is free to take a position for or against the argument that there is a need for Indian Sanskrit scholars with the traditional / insider's understanding to reclaim the authority for Sanskrit Studies.

  

But assuming wrongly that the book is arguing for saving Sanskrit and arguing that nonexistent thesis is misplaced, unwarranted and digressing.
