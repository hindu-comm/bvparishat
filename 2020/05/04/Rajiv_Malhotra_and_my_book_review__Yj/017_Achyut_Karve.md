It is the same thing like creating santuaries for wild animals under titles save the elephant, save the lion when it is man himself who is endangering them.

  

Are the protectors themselves not turning into predators?

  

The question who is killing Sanskrit needs an answer.

  

Who converted Sanskrit from a spoken language to a scripted one?

  

Can regional languages of India save Sanskrit?

  

Do we not need to resurrect the neutral accent of Sanskrit before we can revive it.  

  

Achyut Karve.
