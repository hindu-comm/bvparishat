Your personal recollection contains some information I was not aware of, Dr. Misra. Thank you.

  

Sharing the following for those who may be interested but have not seen:

  

<http://asaa.asn.au/tigers-vs-goats-rajiv-malhotras-battle-for/>contains some views of (now) 2022 Chair of World Sanskrit Conference Prof. McComas Taylor on some views of Sri Rajiv Malhotra.

  

In[https://meghk.wordpress.com/2020/02/10/a-response-to-some-views-expressed-by-the-chair-of-the-world-sanskrit-conference-2021-about-श्री-राम-sri-rama/](https://meghk.wordpress.com/2020/02/10/a-response-to-some-views-expressed-by-the-chair-of-the-world-sanskrit-conference-2021-about-%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE-sri-rama/), I analyze some of Dr. Taylor's own statements, made in his capacity as a subject-matter expert, in interviews. (I will need to change 2021 to 2022 at some point).

  

Also, I was quite piqued by what Dr. Taylor has said, on record (listen and read here<https://meghkalyanasundaram.blogspot.com/2020/05/the-first-sentence-taught-in-sanskrit.html?m=1>), about the first sentence he apparently teaches in Sanskrit. He is, of course, free to teach whatever suits his world-view and preference. I wonder though if anyone else also does what Dr. Taylor does, when it comes to the first sentence they teach.

  

Best,

Megh
