Dear Manogna,

Thank you for posting. It did refresh my memory and reinforced the thought

that it was out of place as a plenary talk. There are no "we-they" or "our-their"

in an international Assembly. The contents of the talk do have merit but they

are not fit for a world body scholars' meeting. it could have been

a paper in the Conference when the contents could be debated.  

I also made a review of the Battle for Sanskrit which should exist in the internet.  

I will check my files.  

Best regards,

BM
