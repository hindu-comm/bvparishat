Welcome, Dr. Misra.

  

I have not heard either Dr. Brockington or Sri Rajiv Malhotra speak inthat conference in 2015.Until I see those videos, you might perhaps understand (and maybe appreciate)my inability and unwillingness to either agree or endorse all your views specific to that conference.

  

Having, like you, read some books of Rajiv-ji (and now your review of one of his books), I know I have learnt *much* *more* than just a thing/idea or two fromRajiv-ji's writings.

  

Dr. Taylor's opinion (in that link) came with hardly anything I could independently verify. I hence decided to look beyond his "opinion" on Rajiv-ji's views and look into what is considered, by some atleast, to be within his professional expertise. Unless someone can show me what I might have missed in my analysis of Dr. Taylor's statements (onदेवी सीता andश्री राम)—even those purportedlyfrom within his area of professional expertise and not just an opinion about an individual—they too seem to be more opinion than being precise, fair and ethical representation of the critical edition of the concerned primary text. Like I have mentioned in my analysis, Dr. Taylor's scholarship cannot be reduced to those two sentences (atleast I cannot do so) and I leave it to those who heave read the statements and the text involved to develop their own informed views.

  

Best,

Megh
