Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste

   

   Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha-1931-1940 (7 Volumes) is available on [archive.org](http://archive.org), but its scan is very bulky.

  

  
<https://archive.org/details/Purnachandra.Odia.Bhashakosha.Complete/mode/2up>

  

   Is there any better scanned copy available?

  

   Thanks and regards

   Narayan Prasad
