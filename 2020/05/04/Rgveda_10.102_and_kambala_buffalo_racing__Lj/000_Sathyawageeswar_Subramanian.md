श्रीगुरुभ्योनमः‌  
  
This post was motivated by some thoughts coming up while reading the following thread:

Reading the सायणभाष्यम् for this सूक्तं (ऋ.१०.१०२), I was repeatedly reminded, in many of the ऋचः, and at several places in the भाष्यम्, of the buffalo racing sport of kambala. Although I only heard of kambala for the first time in my life a few months ago, the reminiscence and resemblance is astonishing. For example, it appears that there are variants of kambala (ನಾಯೆರ್, ಅಡ್ಡ ಪಲಾಯಿ, ಕಣೆ ಪಲಾಯಿ) where a wooden block / plough is attached - to which मुद्गल (मुद्गर = hammer/mace?) and द्रुघण could be related.  
  
Similarly काष्ठा॑या॒ मध्ये॑ द्रुघ॒णं शया॑नं and the related काष्ठानां मध्ये निहितम् शरीरम् (ऋ.१.३२) where सायणाचार्य glosses काष्ठा as waters, in addition to पद्याभिः सरणिभिः (through the channels) अरंहत वेगेनागमत् (raced ahead/through) indicates some potential connection to a field inundated with water, and having canals or channels.  
  
Even more interestingly, आपटे glosses आजि as "place for running; race-course" among other things. And the things won, the गवां सहस्रम् could also easily be a prize in the race.

  
Of course, this explanation doesn't deal with the obvious description of a battle like situation, and the central role of the रथ in the सूक्तम् .  
  
Has such a connection been considered by anyone before? It may be a very ancient indication of a kambala like sport and may provide support for connections to southern India. At the very least, the sport could be inspired from this battle or have been started as an annual tribute to this historical event alluded to in the सूक्त.  
  
Perhaps this may be a topic an Mphil or PhD student could take up for a project, such as those being listed by Indic Academy etc.?

  

Humbly request scholars to share their opinions.
