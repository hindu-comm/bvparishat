Dear Colleagues

  

Thank you for your interest and support in the 18th World Sanskrit Congress (WSC 2021), scheduled for 18-22 January 2021.  
  
We have received a tremendous number of abstracts, which are currently under review, and many of you have already registered to attend the Congress.  
  
Unfortunately, given the continued COVID-19 situation, and the uncertainty regarding international travel to Australia in early 2021, the Organising Committee has made the difficult decision to postpone WSC 2021 for 12 months.  

#### The new scheduled dates are 17-21 January 2022, in Canberra, Australia

We realise that this may result in come inconvenience for those of you who had planned on attending in January 2021, and we thank you for your understanding and patience at this time.  
  
So what happens now?  
  
All abstracts that have been submitted are currently under review, and this will continue. Panel and Special Panel convenors are requestedto continue to finalise the program based on the abstracts we have received. Authors will have the opportunity to withdraw or modify abstracts in early 2021, as desired.  
  
If you have already registered to attend WSC 2021, your registration will be rolled over to 2022. Please contact us via email to [wsc...@kaigi.com.au]() if you would prefer to receive a full refund of your registration fee paid.  
  
We look forward to seeing you in Australia in 2022!  
  
*McComas Taylor*  
On behalf of the WSC2021 Organising Committee
