\<\< *LLA is in common use such as పెళ్ళి and other words.* \>\>

  

It is not the geminate ళ్ళ that is being discussed here. It is a different sound transcribed in English as "zh" by Malayalis and Tamils.
The written character looks like ഴ and ழ in Malayalam and Tamil respectively. I believe the ancient Telugu character ఴ represents this sound that disappeared from the language a long time ago.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
