Ignorant people like Rajan should stop imposing such things on Telugu language. What does he mean RRA is not in use now? Ignoramus! My family name uses this letter, and I use it today. LLA is in common use such as పెళ్ళి and other words. Who forms this association? Who are they to impose these letters in Telugu even if only digitally. There is a risk in this to Telugu language, and I protest! I will also write to Hindu and this association.

  

Thanks to Prof Paturi for bringing it to our notice.

  

Regards,

Pillalamarri Krishna Kumar
