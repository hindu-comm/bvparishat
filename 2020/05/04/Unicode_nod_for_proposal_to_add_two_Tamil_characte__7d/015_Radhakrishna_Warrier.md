I just Googled "Bali or Vali", and this blog was one of the many results that came up:

  

<https://www.blog.sagarworld.com/hinduism/puranas-hindu-mythology/ramayan-ramanand-sagar/ramayan-characters/bali-vanar-king-vali/>

  

The blogger uses both versions of the name (the 'b' and 'v' versions).
So both versions might have been prevalent in the past. Ezhuthachan (author of Malayalam Adhyatma Ramayana) probably chose the 'b' version thinking the 'v' version might be a little disrespectful because of its association with vƒÅl (tail) üôÇ
