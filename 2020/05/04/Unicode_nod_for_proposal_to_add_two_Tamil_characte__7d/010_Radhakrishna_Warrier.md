There is a phrase in Malayalam "*Bāli kēṟā mala*" meaning the mountain that Bāli (Sugrīva’s older brother) cannot climb, implying anything that is almost impossible for someone. From my experience it appears to me that the zha sound is a "Bāli kēṟā mala" for many non-Malayali Indians.
 Tamil has this sound, and it is there in the very name of the language, yet a large number of Tamils find this sound difficult and pronounce it as retroflex 'l'. At the same time, even a four year old Malayali child pronounces this sound effortlessly.
