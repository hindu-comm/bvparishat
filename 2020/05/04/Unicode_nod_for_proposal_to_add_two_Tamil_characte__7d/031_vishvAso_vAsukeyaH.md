A correction about the above:

\- Grantha and Tamil technically merit having separate unicode blocks - scripts are quite different - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_(Unicode_block)> vs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grantha_(Unicode_block)> .

\- From what I hear, lemurians were stridently blocking the formation of this separate block itself.
