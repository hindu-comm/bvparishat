Mr. Shreevatsa,

  

Thanks for elucidating the issue. Allow me to present a counter point: Let us take the LLL as the issue here. (as in Tamil). The contention is that there is an old Telugu letter which was discontinued for over a century. (or centuries, for that matter). So Rajan's (and your) contention is that it is not a big deal to dump it completely and use Tamil characters. For a typical Telugu writer/reader, both the 'old' Telugu character and the Tamil character are new, so why not the Tamil character is another way to put your argument. My point is to say the same thing: if anyway the Telugu reader of that sound needs to learn a new character, why not the old Telugu character? It would revive the character and the basis for that sound to be introduced in Telugu again. But the main issue is not only this. The 'gunintas ', or the critics that mark various sounds formed with that character plus the vowels, don't fit either with the Tamil character or with the Tamil character writing style. So you are arguing for an unnatural inclusion of the foreign character. Similar imports in the plant world have sometimes disturbed the local vegetation. Why do it when unnecessary? Also, there was no widespread dissemination of this issue before it was approved. RRR presents a similar case.

  

Can you be kind enough to let me know the contact details of the people involved in Unicode consortium who are party to this decision? I would like to talk to them and convince them of the unreasonableness of their action.

  

Regards,

Krishna Kumar Pillalamarri
