It is unfortunate that the literature gets flooded (invaded) to analyze the

form of the Indian languages. It is done by people who have little to do

with the use of the language. I am ignorant about the origin of such

imposition and rebel when I see the crude characterization. A wholesome

sanitizing of Indian linguistics should be the call on behalf of Indian people.
