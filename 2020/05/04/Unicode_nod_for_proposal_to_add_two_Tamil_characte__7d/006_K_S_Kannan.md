While these linguists admire English for enriching itself with the vocabulary from other languages,

they are eager to divest their own languages of the rich vocabulary derived from Sanskrit!

  

While English expands its repertoire of phonetic representations  

(so that the sounds of all languages can be correctly represented in print)

deploying additional and artificial characters/diacritics,

these "linguists" (virtual haters of Sanskrit, the Veda-s, and Brahminism overtly/covertly),

are divesting the alphabets taught to kids of many Sanskrit letters/sounds

(such as vowels like R), and want to truncate all aspirate consonants

and mutilate and disfigure the very alphabetical systems of regional languages.

  

Their typical argument :  

Learning the vowel R is such a burden for the kids!
