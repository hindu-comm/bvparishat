Coming back to the original issue:

there was an attempt by the Central Govt. to create a new Devanagari,

by adding a few diacritics etc., so that  

all Indian (sounds/scripts of) languages could be represented in this Devanagari.

  

Refer to the publication:

*Parivardhita Devanagari* (40 pp.)*  
*

1967, Delhi : Kendriya Hindi Nideshanalay.

  

I do not know if (and how much of) this is in current use.
