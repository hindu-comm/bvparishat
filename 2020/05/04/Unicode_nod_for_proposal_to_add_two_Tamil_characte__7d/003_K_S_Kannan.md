And do you know what?

Our ultramodern linguists have begun to theorise

that there is now a "sound shift" in Telugu happening:

*sha* and *Sha* are getting replaced by *Sha* only:

the *tAlavya* sound is getting extinct.

Who writes "Suresh" now?; all write "SureSh",

ie. the mUrdhanya sound only.

  

Lazy to learn proper pronunciation,

they are quick to make fancy theorisations.  

  

And the scholar was admonishing Kannada linguists:

Kannada people do not have such courage  

\- to disown whatever is inherited from Sanskrit!

  

Have you heard of DNSBhat?:

An abomination in many ways!
