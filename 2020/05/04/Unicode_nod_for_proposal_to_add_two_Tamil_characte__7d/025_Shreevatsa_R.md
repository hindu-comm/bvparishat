Regarding the original topic of this thread: The proposal under discussion is here:<https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2020/20119-two-telugu-letters.pdf>

  

To give some brief context: currently (as of Unicode 13, i.e. before this proposal), the [Telugu block](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Telugu_(Unicode_block)&oldid=947689787) in Unicode has 98 characters assigned:

(See the[Unicode chart](https://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0C00.pdf)or [other](https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/block/telugu/list.htm) online sources.)

  

This proposal suggests using two of the unused slots, namely 0C5B and 0C5C, for two characters representing Tamil sounds, and which have a well-attested history of being used in books printed in the Telugu script. It is a sound proposal, and gives nearly a dozen examples ofsuch usage already existing in practice, in printed books ranging from 1898 to 2002, so over a century. Of course these are Tamil or Manipravalabooks printed in the Telugu script, but note that the Unicode block is meant for the Telugu script, not the Telugu language. It makes sense that the proposal was accepted.

  

It is not clear what people are complainingabout. How is this "imposition"? No one is forced to use these letters. (Nor will they, unless they happen to need them, specifically for something like typesetting Tiruppavai or some other text in the Telugu script.) I wouldn't be surprised if most of the people complaining about this haven't even taken a few seconds to find the original proposal, and react based on just newspaper reports.

  

This is like the earlier silly controversy about the Grantha characters, where Tamil groups raised a fuss about their beloved Tamil script being "polluted" with Sanskrit letters (getting support from their sympathizers in US academia), resulting in separate Unicode blocks for Tamil and Grantha for no good reason other than"considering the sensitivity involved".
