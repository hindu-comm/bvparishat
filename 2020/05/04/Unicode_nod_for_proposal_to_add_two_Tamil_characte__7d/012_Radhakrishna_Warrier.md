\<\<*Malayalam does not have the 'v' sound?* \>\>

  

This is an interesting question. I think most Indian languages do not have a 'v' or a 'w' sound the way native English speakers pronounce these. However, excepting some eastern Indian languages such as Bengali and Odia, most Indian languages, including Malayalam, have a 'v' sound that is neither the 'v' nor the 'w' of English, but is a little closer to English 'w' than to English 'v'. This pan Indian 'v' sound is transcribed in Devanagari asव , in Malayalam as വ, and in Tamil as வ. Different allophones of this sound might exist in the dialects of the standard Indian languages.
