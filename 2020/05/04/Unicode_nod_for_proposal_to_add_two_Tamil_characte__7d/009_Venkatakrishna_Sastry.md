On Prof. KSK \<' English - diacritics- artificail characters - learning burden on kids \> A complex theme.



Just adding (A) one more perspective of thinking citing warning given by Patanjali 

and

(B) suggesting an exercise to figure out what 'english' pronunciation- script is being taught in diacritic marked Samskrit ( or other Romanized scripting of Devanagari Samskruth/ Indiac languages )



***A. Patanjali's warning***: A word in a langauge goes wrong when the ' basic unit of language/ word / Varna- Akshara' - becomes bad, abused, misused.

दुष्टः शब्दः - स्वरतो वर्णातो वा , मिथ्या-प्रयुक्तः - न तमर्थं आह ।

duṣṭaḥ śabdaḥ - svaratō varṇātō vā , mithyā-prayuktaḥ - na tamarthaṁ āha \| 



 The 'abuse- misuse' (by pronnciation, script, mismatch of script and sound) begins by the ' Compromise - Crippling of Langauge' in SCHOOL TEACHING', in teaching ' inaccurate pronunciation of script 



 ***The*** ***Corollary of this*** ***are***: 



 Have we trained our Samskruth instructors to get the shuddha- 'Devanagari/ Brahmi - uccharana by Panini-Patanjali standards ? Do we at all have a system in school / Gurukuls to ensure this 'Shuddhah Pathyante' sampradaya of Patanjali ?

  Have we benn able to see cearly the osmosis of ' Local differentials of regional langauges pronunication on Samskruth' and 'Distortions of Romanized representation in pronunciaiton' proliferated through our school education system ?



The First sep to correct this in tradition is called ' Akshara- Abhyasa': A yoga training for right articulation of Sounds. 



Samskruth linguists reocognized this in the statement : Shikshaa is the foundation of Vyakarana; Vyakarana needs to be in the bounds of NIRUKTA
for ' word Meaning Decision'.

This guidance of unified approach of Shikshaa -Vyakarana- Nirukta::
The combined wisdom endorsed by Paini-Patanjali-Yaska is given a good go bye by modern linguists ! using the argument : -' It is a burden for the kids' !







***B.English pronuncation standards : ***In the current period,
Unicode and IPA usurped auhtoity on 'How to script- represent sound and say Paninian language. 

The english pronunciation of Roman alphabets itself does not fall in line with the standards of voice -set in IPA for english speaking in a specific region of UK a few centuries ago.

# Here is a link for a 8 minute vidoe on ' Interactive Phonetic chart for English pronunciation'. <https://youtu.be/0HeujZ45OZE> . Watch it and contemplate how our present working understanding and debate on linking 'Devanagari Script- Roman alphabet by mapping / The Phonetic associations of symbols with pronunciation, the principles of organization of characters and numeric count' make any meaningful sense ! Probably, the 'Samvruta- vivruta' debate may get a clarificatory note here. For more details explore : <https://www.internationalphoneticalphabet.org/ipa-sounds/ipa-chart-with-sounds/> . For more technically savvy persons, explore the ' tones and accents links, more symbols'. Then go to IPA- Unicode linking at IPA symbols with Unicode decimal and hex codes

While these linguists admire English for enriching itself with the vocabulary from other languages,
