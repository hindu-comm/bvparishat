"*Our ultramodern linguists have begun to theorise* *that there is now a "sound shift" in Telugu happening:*

*sha and Sha are getting replaced by Sha only:*

*the tAlavya sound is getting extinct.*

*Who writes "Suresh" now?; all write "SureSh",* *ie. the mUrdhanya sound only.*"

  

This has been happening for a long time in Malayalam; Suresh's and Ramesh's of Kerala now write their names as Surƒì·π£, Ramƒì·π£ etc (‡§∏‡•Å‡§∞‡•á‡§∑‡•ç, ‡§∞‡§Æ‡•á‡§∑‡•ç etc.). This is not because of any sound shift. The sounds ≈õa and ·π£a are still very distinct in Malayalam. This happened because people dropped the original forms like Surƒì≈õa·πâ, Ramƒì≈õa·πâ, etc. and went for the more fashionable (in their eyes) north Indian forms Suresh, Ramesh etc.
Lacking a good knowledge of the Devanagari or other north Indian scripts, they thought that ‚Äòsh‚Äô in these names represented ·π£ (‡¥∑‡µç, ‡§∑‡•ç).
Little did they know that most north Indians use English ‚Äòsh‚Äô to represent ≈õ (‡¥∂‡µç, ‡§∂‡•ç) also üòä

  

I know a Malayali who named his newborn son Arnab and wrote the name in Malayalam as ƒÅrnƒÅb (‡¥Ü‡µº‡¥®‡¥æ‡¥¨‡µç ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ç‡§®‡§æ‡§¨‡•ç) and pronounced the ‚ÄònƒÅb‚Äô not as ‚ÄònƒÅb‚Äô but as the English word ‚Äònab‚Äô, little realizing that the original name stood for Ar·πáav (Sanskrit Ar·πáava ‡§Ö‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§µ).
