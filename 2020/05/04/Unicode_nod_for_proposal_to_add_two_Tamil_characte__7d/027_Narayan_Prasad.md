Why is it said two characters, when out of these two one is already in use in Telugu?  

Consider the word "gurramu" (horse).

I have checked in two dictionaries - C.P. Brown's Telugu-English Dictionary (2nd edition, 1979/1992, AES) giving the spellingగుర్రము.

  

But the 1998 (first edition) of English-Telugu dictionary gives:గుఱ్ఱము. (see the attached pics.)

About 35 years back I saw only the latter spelling in a very preliminary Telugu book.

Narayan Prasad
