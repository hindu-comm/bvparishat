Friends,

  

I did receive requests from several members (could be a dozen)

to send my file on Science and Technology - Indus to 1947.

I would assume I would receive some feedback in course of time.

The material is massive and it could take time to go through.

  

At India discovery Center we segment India's cultural history

in six tracks: Geography and People, Art and Culture, Language

and Literature, Philosophy and Religion, Economy and Politics,

Science and Technology. Now we have compiled material in each

track to study the time evolution. I can share with people if you have

research interests. People can send private mail. Each track may  

have more than two hundred slides. People who wish to browse can  

view the slides at our website http;//[www.indiadiscoverycenter.org](http://www.indiadiscoverycenter.org)  

under the title "seminars".

  

We would be preparing summary seminars in the Fall. Any input from

the scholars would be gratefully acknowledged.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
