Dear scholars,

I am looking for apt expression in Sanskrit for 'hatching an egg'.

The context is स्पर्शदीक्षा.

Three kinds of dīkşā-s are there - स्मृतिदीक्षा, दर्शनदीक्षा and स्पर्शनदीक्षा.

By hatching the mother-bird helps the offspring for evolution or manifestation. In the same vein, the master is said to help the śişya to get initiated.

Kindly help.

nks
