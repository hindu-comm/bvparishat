Dear Dr Kannan,

Thank you for the references.

I have already noticed the passages you cited from Atharvaveda, Satapathabrahmanaand Sanatsujatiya.

I would like to get the exact reference of the Yogavasishtha and the Upanishadic passages. Shall check.

However what I am looking for is the description of the act of hatching by a bird; and the exact word for the act.

Regards,

nks
