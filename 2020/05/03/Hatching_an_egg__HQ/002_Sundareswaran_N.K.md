That's right.

I have seen this.

But I want to know whether there is the usage of this anywhere in the Classical literature.

I want to express this idea in Sanskrit: "Just as a bird, hatching the egg, protects, cares and help the infant to come out as a chick, the master protects,cares and help the incumbent to get initiated/evolved, by the warmth of his touch."
