Dear Achyut Ji,

  

  You have asked some interesting questions to which I don't have rational explanations. I started composing Sanskrit verses, translating from Marathi, Hindi and English poetry into Sanskrit beginning with the final year (1962) of my high school in Pune and continued writing Sanskrit poems until I finished my master's degree in Pune and then migrated to US to do my PhD in 1968. During my work on my Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania (1968-72) and during my tenure as a Professor of Sanskrit and Linguistics at the University of Michigan (1972-2017) there was no local audience for Sanskrit poetry and the internet forums had not taken their current form. In Jan of 2017, during a flight from Pune to Detroit, I composed a comic Sanskrit poem on my experience in Pune, and this was the beginning of my rekindled enthusiasm for composing poetry in Sanskrit. Then I wrote a 50 verse poem on a conversation between Sītā and Rāvaṇa in 2017-18, and after that started writing verses on Krishna. The Krishna verses almost possessed my mind, so that often I woke up in the middle of the night to write down 15 or 20 verses at a stretch. When I finished the first 50, I called it a Pañcāśikā, then when I finished the first 100, I called it a Śatakam, then it reached 500, 1000 and now I have written about 1300 verses so far. I share only one verse a day, but often write a dozen or so at a stretch. Why do I write these verses? Purely for my inner satisfaction. At this stage in my life, I am retired, and I am not working for a promotion, or a raise in my salary, and not for any awards from anyone. If the readers like these verses and communicate their happiness to me, I am of course happy. But other than that, my only reward is the happiness I derive from composing these verses. This delight is much more satisfying to me than the 15 research volumes and 200+ research articles I have written during my academic career. This is the best I can say in response to your question. Thank you for asking. With best regards,
