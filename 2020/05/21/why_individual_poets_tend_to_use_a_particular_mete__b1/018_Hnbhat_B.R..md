"while in the epic style poetry, generally one meter was used in one Sarga or Adhyāya with the final verse in a different meter"

Prof.Madhav Deshpande

  

Dandin inluded this feature in the लक्षण of Mahakavya:

  

अलंकृतमसंक्षिप्तं रसभावनिरन्तरम्  
सर्गैरनतिविस्तीर्णैः श्रव्यवृत्तैः सुसंधिभिः ।। १.१८ ।।  

  

***सर्वत्र भिन्नवृत्तान्तैरुपेतं*** लोकरञ्जनम्  
काव्यं कल्पान्तरस्थायि जायते सदलंकृति ।। १.१९ ।।

  

Vishvanatha clearly states in his Sahityadarpana 6.320

  

एकवृत्तमयैः पद्यैरवसानेऽन्यवृत्तकैः।

  

But this is followed generally. But you can find sarga-s with different meters sometime as 4th sarga in Shishupalavadha and 5th in in Kiratarjuniya.
