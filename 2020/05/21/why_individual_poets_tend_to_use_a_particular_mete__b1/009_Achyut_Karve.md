Dear Vidwans,

  

I have been studying the Tabla for the past 40 years. The compositions of the tabla are set to teen taal of 16 beats which are divided into two parts of 8 beats each. These two cycles end differently. The first ending called the kaal or falling intonation and the second of rising intonation. This fits in well with the anushtubh chanda. What amuses me is that the compositions muse even when they do not carry any meaning and that too inspite of they containing letters, padas and sentences.

  

I would like Madhav Deshpande to reflect within himself to fathom what makes him compose shlokas day after day for over an year now.

  

Again the question whether the egg first or the hen first, the content first or the form (meter) first?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
