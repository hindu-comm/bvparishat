In my observation, in Muktaka style poetry, like the Śatakas of Bhartr̥hari, the poets switched from meter to meter, while in the epic style poetry, generally one meter was used in one Sarga or Adhyāya with the final verse in a different meter. In the R̥gveda too, generally a sūkta uses one meter throughout, while sūktas with different meters are relatively few. My personal experience of writing Sanskrit verses is that if I am writing in a given meter, that tune remains constantly in my mind and words naturally flow into that meter. The other possible reasons for choosing a certain meter are the size of the content one wants to express. While an anuṣṭubh śloka will express a relatively smaller sized content, meters like Sragdharā will express larger amount of content in a single verse. Also, some meters like Mandākrānta or Sragdharā appear slow-paced due to their metrical structure, meters like Mālinī, Bhujaṅgaprayāta etc. have a faster pace, and this may determine why a poet may decide to use a certain meter. For example, I cannot imagine theMeghadūtabeing in any other meter than Mandākrāntā. Its slow pace just fits the melancholy mood of Viraha. There is probably no one size fits all kind of explanation, but these are my thoughts. With best regards,
