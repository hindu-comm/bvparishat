Dear Deshpandeji,

  

Could you through light on the likeness and difference in visualization of prose and poetry?

  

Does the poet count when he compiles?

  

The reason for the above question is our Guru used to say ताल (meter) दिल में होता है। What is your experience?

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
