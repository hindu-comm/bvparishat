Since Sri Achyut Karve-ji responded after Nalopakhyanam was posted, I think he is wondering about why something like Anushthub is

continuously used in such big numbers.

  

If he would have observed the whole text of Mahabharata, he would have noted that there are many other meters that are used in Mahabharata.

  

But the use of Anushthub in a greater ratio than the other meters can still be a question in his mind.

  

Anushthub has really been the most used meter for Puranas and other Aarsha literature.

  

That point has widely been discussed in the past.

  

If this is his question , his observation that it is an individual poet's choice is mistaken.

  

If his observation is based on other cases, let us see his examples.
