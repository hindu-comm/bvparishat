Dear Prof Deshpande,

My heart-felt Congratulations to you that from starting Verse-1 in 2018, you have reached today to Verse-1111 !!   I personally consider this as an auspicious no.

  

I am enjoying your verses as लिखित मंत्र, by writing down **one** Verse each day in a Notebook. My Pranams to you.

  

I have now understood, why you politely declined my suggestion to undertake the important Task of rewriting the Bhagavatam (of Vyasa) in an easy,simple,sweet Sanskrit (pleasing to recite)as the Service to Humanity !!

  

I wish you all the Best in your persuits.  
-Ashok Gudsoorkar
