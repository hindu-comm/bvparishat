Dear Achyut Ji,

  

  Since my childhood, I had memorized many Sanskrit stotras at home, for example the रामरक्षास्तोत्र which contains many different meters. I had heard my grandfatherand father recite these daily, and later while learning Sanskrit and Marathi, we memorized and recited numerous verses in different meters. In our examinations at theTilak Vidyapeeth and at the regular high school, we were tested on definitions and examples of various meters. Those tunes are fixed in my mind, and when I write a line of a verse, I recite it mentally and if it fits the tunes that I have in my memory, I do not need to count syllables. Writing prose, especially academically rigorousprose for publication, I do it thoughtfully and consciously, unlike writing poetry, which often is how one imagines an idea, rather than examining it using logic or evidence.
This is the best I can characterize these different modes. With best wishes,
