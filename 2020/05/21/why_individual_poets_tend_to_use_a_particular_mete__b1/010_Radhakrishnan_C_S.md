Kalidasa's usage of Mandakranta in Meghasandesa set the trend for almost all the later Sandesakavyas like Hamsasandesa, Kokilasandesa, Bhramarasandesa etc. To use the same metre of Mandakranta.

Also, Kalidasa used such metres in tune with the part of the story. He used Viyogini metre for the lamentation of Rati in the fourth canto of Kumarasambhava and the same Viyogini for Aja Vilapa in the Raghuvamsa.

Bhavabhuti is known for his usage of Sikharini. It is said' Bhavabhuteh Sikharini nirargala tarangini.
