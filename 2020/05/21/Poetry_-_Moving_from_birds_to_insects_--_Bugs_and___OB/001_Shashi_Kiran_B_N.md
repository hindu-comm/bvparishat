Dear Venkatakrishna Sastry-ji,

  

Neither Dr. Ganesh nor Dr. Shankar interprets *Citra-kāvya* as "composing poetry that resonates a  
picture" or "painting a picture that resonates a creative idea." You perhaps confused *Kāvya-citra* *Jugalbandi* (that Dr. Ganesh performs with the renowned painter B K S Verma) with *Citra-kāvya.* In a few of his *Avadhāna* performances, Dr. Ganesh has composed verses based on paintings. Even this, I'm afraid, is not *Citra-kāvya*.  

  

In making this statement you probably had *gati-citra* and *bandha-citra* in mind. They are only subsets of *Citra-kāvya*, well-established in the theory and practice of Sanskrit poetry since Daṇḍī and Bhāravi. Besides, Dr. Ganesh and Dr. Shankar have both composed *Citra-kāvya* of all sorts extensively.  

  

Further, Dr. Shankar has endeavoured to invest *Citra-kāvya* with natural poetic charm and appeal. "Dominant poetic pedantry" does not qualify his compositions. You may please read his introductory remarks in *Citra-naiṣadham*. \[I'm well aware of ānanda-vardhana's stand in this matter. Nonetheless, we must not forget the fact that he authored *Devī-śataka*, a celebrated *Citra-kāvya.*\]

  

Your explanation not only misrepresents but also belittles the extraordinarily complex poetic exercise that is *Citra-kāvya*.  *  
*

Thank you.

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
