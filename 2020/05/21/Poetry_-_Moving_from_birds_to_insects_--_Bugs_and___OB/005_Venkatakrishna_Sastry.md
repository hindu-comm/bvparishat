Namaste Prof. KSK



I have clarified the use of expression \< chitra-kavya> in the original post and another post. 



My statement was very simple : \< I am placing a picture (googled image) **and** a small compisition \>. It is a simple association of Figure with Picture' :: 'Roopa / chitra ' with a 'roopaka'; Drushya with Shravya/ Paathya'.

The simplicity of Bharata muni's terminology gets a 'alamkara shaastra' techniclaity in later works of poetics.



In current Digital documents, this model is called ' Digital Book/ Picture-Poetry/ Picture book, Idea- Illustrated composiiton'.



I am not contesting or going on the lane of \<shabdaartha chitra kaavya…. et al> : The technicality as given by Mammata in Kavya Prakasha: Excerpt mage placed below from source <https://archive.org/details/KavyaPrakash/page/n396/mode/1up>

Please see the translation of 'Chitra-Kavya' as ' Figure- Pictorial'
by Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. Sir Ganganatha Jha.



For a word justiifcation, my explanation of ' Chitra -Kavya' here is Chitram cha Kavyam cha'- as 'dvandva. It is Picture and Poem together.
Is there any inconsistency or vioaltion ?



I have not claimed that the presentation to be aligned to
\<chitra-kavya> of classical model. I have had my experimentation with that model else where. Not necessary to go for details here. 



I have all apprecation for the creative genius and skill of Dr. Shankar in composing \< Chitra kavya-bandhas> which stand by the
definiitons in classical texts and practice. and his Guru Shatavadhani
Dr. R.Ganesh.
