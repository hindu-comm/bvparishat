Namaste Shashikiran



In the presented composiiton,



1. I was connecting two idea words : Chitra : Picture and Kavya: Composition :: A poem inspired by or detailing a given picture / Putting together a picture to illustrate the inspiration behind a composiiton.



Did the composiiton and image presented gel together? Did it achieve that goal ? Could you enjoy the idea communicated in the composiiton along with the image ? Any improvements, suggestions ?

The composiiton is a narative of about ten couplets.
Technically this model comes under the calssificaiton of free flowing poetry (mukta- kaavya). The structure compares /resonates with the english poetry model of 'sonnet'.



A sonnet is a one-stanza, 14-line poem, written in iambic pentameter. The sonnet, which derived from the Italian word sonetto, meaning “a little sound or song," is "a popular classical form that has compelled poets for centuries,". The most common—and simplest—type is known as the English or Shakespearean sonnet, but there are several other types. Since its introduction into English in the 16th century, the 14-line sonnet form has remained relatively stable, proving itself a flexible container for all kinds of poetry, long enough that its images and symbols can carry detail rather than becoming cryptic or abstract, and short enough to require a distillation of poetic thought. For more extended poetic treatment of a single theme, some poets have written sonnet cycles, a series of sonnets on related issues often addressed to a single person.

Please let me know how you enjoyed the composition.



*For techniclaity of classical analysis: *

**

 The presented composiiton was not a single ' poem' ( muktaka/ kulaka model) ! It is not a whole chapter like a sarga, khandakavya with a continuing theme.

**

 What I have presented does not come under the techniclaites of ' *gati-citra* and *bandha-citra' !* I am clear on this point about the
presented composiiton. It does not come under techncial 'chitra-kavya' category ! No Confusion.

 The presentation is a simple ' Chitra -Varnanaa' = ' Chitra-darshana- uddepita- bhavaakhyaana ; kaavya -bhaava -pradarshaka -chitram'. I am clear on this point. 



 Therefore, the presented composition can not be analysed under the techniclaity of ' Chitra-Kavaya- lakshana' where 'shabda -vicahitrya' and 'gati-bandha' gets dominance (praadhaanyataa) over the meaning (artha- taatparya/ rasa-

vyanjanaa).



Please contemplate on this pointer to understand the technical difference between the expressions you have used to ' analyse the presented composition'. 



 Please analyse the composition whether the 'shabdas' used block / delay the ' bhaava- grahana' .

Knowing theory of poetics is information (shaastra jnaana).. Knowledge of using right application of theory for analysis ( kaavya- vimarsha- abhyaasa) is a different exercise and skill.

Please take time to read I.A.Richards and others on ' Practical Literary Criticism' and its practice.



2. Rest of the issues ( or non issues):



 2a. Thank you for regurgitating a classicaldefiniiton of ' chitra-kavya' from a classical alamkara shastra text position ! It was not necessary. Your post helped me to refresh my memory. 



 2b The intention of my post was not to trigger any debate on interpretation and practice of ' Chitra-Kavya parampara'. and 'Chitra kavya- samkhya bandha' demonstrations in avadhana.



2c. I have good personal acquainance with Shatavadhani Dr. R.Ganesh and Shankar and their works. I have high regard for their work and Creative composiitons, writings. 



 2d. I have been on the stage and off the stage in creative composition exercises of ' Kavya-Chitra jugalabndhi's, Chitra kavaya avadnam. with Dr. R. Ganesh and other avadhani's.

My acquanitance with R.Ganesh is more than three decades old. I do know how the 'Chitra kavya' was given a life through avadhanam and its later stage presentations modified as ' Kavya-Chitra/ Nrutya models'.

Dear Venkatakrishna Sastry-ji,



Neither Dr. Ganesh nor Dr. Shankar interprets *Citra-kāvya* as "composing poetry that resonates a picture" or "painting a picture that resonates a creative idea." You perhaps confused *Kāvya-citra* *Jugalbandi* (that Dr. Ganesh performs with the renowned painter B K S Verma) with *Citra-kāvya**.* In a few of his *Avadhāna* performances, Dr. Ganesh has composed verses based on paintings. Even this, I'm afraid, is not *Citra-kāvya*.



In making this statement you probably had *gati-citra* and *bandha-citra* in mind. They are only subsets of *Citra-kāvya*, well-established in the theory and practice of Sanskrit poetry since Daṇḍī and Bhāravi. Besides, Dr. Ganesh and Dr. Shankar have both composed *Citra-kāvya* of all sorts extensively.



Further, Dr. Shankar has endeavoured to invest *Citra-kāvya* with natural poetic charm and appeal. "Dominant poetic pedantry" does not qualify his compositions. You may please read his introductory remarks in *Citra-naiṣadham*. \[I'm well aware of ānanda-vardhana's stand in this matter. Nonetheless, we must not forget the fact that he authored *Devī-śataka*, a celebrated *Citra-kāvya.*\]



Your explanation not only misrepresents but also belittles the extraordinarily complex poetic exercise that is *Citra-kāvya*. 



Thank you.



Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
