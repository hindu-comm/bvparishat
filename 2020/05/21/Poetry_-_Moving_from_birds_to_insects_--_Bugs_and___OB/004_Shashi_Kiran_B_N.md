Dear Venkatakrishna Sastry-ji,

  

My comment was limited to the note preceding your verses. I could not view the image you have attached--the file format appears to be incompatible with my image processors.Anyway, taken independently, the composition is mildly amusing.

  

I'm happy to learn of your acquaintance with Dr. Ganesh and Dr. Shankar.

  

Thank you.

  

Best regards,

Shashi Kiran B N
