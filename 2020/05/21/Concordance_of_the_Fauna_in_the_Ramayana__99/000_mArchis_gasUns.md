Hariom,

  

 I'm working on a index to Ramayana and would love to get a scan of:

  

Indian Historical Quarterly \> Volume XXVIII, Issue 2, 1952 \> Concordance of the Fauna in the Ramayana

  

<http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.120027/208259/004>

  

Has anyone ever seen Indian Historical Quarterly? Not here in Russia,

  

M.G.
