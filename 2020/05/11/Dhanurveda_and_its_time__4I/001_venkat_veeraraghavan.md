Tantra just refers to technique.

  

I know that Vedic vs Tantric is a game that many modern researchers/practitioners like to use, but this is not supported by tradition.

nyaasa is merely a technique used to divide the shakti of the mantra in specific parts of the body so that the maxim of "shivo bhutva shivam yajet" can be realised. Afterall any person is trying to find the nature of the object through the medium of the subject (self). Hence one has to first become Shiva before one can realise Shiva.....only the infinite can realise the infinite....the finite cannot seek to define or categorise the infinite.

  

There is nyaasa in the usage of gAyatri japa (for sandhyavandana) and purascharana.

There is nyaasa for balaatibala hymns based on gAyatri transmitted from Vishvamitra to Rama./Lakshmana.

  

A mantra is merely packaged shakti. Whether its source is the veda or a tantric sampradaya, the usage will be based on the limitations of the individual.

Think of mantra as a vehicle (bus/train/airplane) the person has to travel from where they are which may be Chennai/Mumbai /Kolkata to say Delhi, for each starting place: the vehicle, the duration and other parameters change.

  

The parashara smriti says that in Satya yuga the prana existed in the bones, in tretha in the flesh in dvaapara in blood and now in kali comes from food. You will notice a gradual extroversion of prana with the progress of the ages.

We therefore now have stupid humans and smart phones (YAY!!!) ..that was a joke btw. I need to make these disclaimers as people get offended ;-)

  

So based on the above dating a treatise is fraught with danger since the yugas are cyclic as are the modes and expressions of shakti.

To say that a word was used in a certain epoch alone or from a certain epoch alone betrays tremendous hubris and a certain delusion of omniscience that any man can ill afford.

  

My 2 cents.
