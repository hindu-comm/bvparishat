Respected Members,

  

I was going through the Dhanurveda of Vasiṣṭha. I found that on the time ofAṅganyāsa, the mantras are mentioned in the tantric form, for instance: Oṃ hrīṃ śikhāsthāne śaṅkarāya namaḥ. In the Introduction of the book *Vasiṣṭa's Dhanurvedasamhitā*, translated by Purnima Ray, the translatermentions that according to Sri. P. C. Chakravarti, the book *cannot be dated before 17th Century A.D. as it mentions "Chatrapati."* I want to knowif the declarationof Sri Chakravarti is authentic till now or not. If not, then It will be a source of reference that Tantra existed at the time ofRāmāyaṇa too.

  

Yours sincerely,
