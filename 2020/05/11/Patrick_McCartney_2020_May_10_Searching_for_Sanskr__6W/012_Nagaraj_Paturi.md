As rightly pointed out by Dr Irene Galstian, revival of Hebrew and the current efforts to popularize spoken Sanskrit are two different animals altogether.

  

But I would not mention 'over 1 billion living speakers of languages that have quite a bit in common with Sanskrit, MUCH more than Yiddish has in common with Biblical Hebrew' that Dr Galstian mentioned to bring home /prove this distinction.

  

Communication , both speaking and writing , in Sanskrit has always been a continuous tradition , a nirantaraayaparamparaa upto the present times unlike for Hebrew. It does not mean that it has been in use among the same strata of people among whom it was in use centuries ago. But albeit as a second language, it has been in continuous communication, spoken and written, among Veda and Shaastra scholars. There are reflections and documentations of this fact in the past several centuries in several texts in Sanskrit and regional languages. In a narrative poem Aamuktamaalyadawritten by the scholarly poet-king, not a Brahmin, Sri Krishna Deva Raya, there are descriptions of Sanskrit being used while serving food to scholars in the dining halls too. Adhyayana adhyaapana paramparaa for Vedic and shaastric paaThas'aalashas continuously been in Sanskrit medium throughout India. For some acdemicdisciplines, for a certain period of time, this was replaced by Prakrit medium and Sanskrit medium was revived after that period in some of the disciplines while regional language media replaced Sanskrit and Prakrit in some fields. But in the fields of Vedic and Shaastric adhyayanaadhyaapana, neither Prakrit, nor regional languages replaced Sanskrit. This situation of Sanskrit being a pan-Indic lingua franca among Vedic and Shaastric scholars is what helped travel of scholars from one corner of the sub-continent to the other for learning in those fields. It is that version of Sanskrit that we hear even now in paaThas'aalasvaakyaartha/s'aastraartha sabhaas.

  

Many Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit speakers face criticisms and corrections from Vedic and Shaastric scholars who speak this traditionalversion of Sanskrit.

That said, the criticism against Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit too is unfair and irrational.
