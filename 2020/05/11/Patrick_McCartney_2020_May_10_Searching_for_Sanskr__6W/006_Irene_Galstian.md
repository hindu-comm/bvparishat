The news article is linked to a 48 page paper McCartney wrote with Zuckermann, an Israeli scholar. In it, the revival of Sanskrit is compared unfavourably with the revival of Hebrew as the national language of Israel. But I don't think this comparison works. It's true, as Zuckermann would agree, that large numbers of Jews came to live in newly formed Israel and were speaking Yiddish and the language of whichever European country they came from. Hebrew was known to them inasmuch as the Tanak is read in Hebrew on religious occasions, and since Yiddish has some imprint from Hebrew. From there, Israeli government had to institute processes by which Yiddish was displaced and Modern Hebrew was put in place as the national language, and this the government did with a lot of persistence and a good deal of success.

But in India, there are over 1 billion living speakers of languages that have quite a bit in common with Sanskrit, MUCH more than Yiddish has in common with Biblical Hebrew.

It's true that the Samskrita Bharati-engineered 'Sanskrit' is grist to the mill of critics like McCartney, but the future doesn't have to be like the past. There is space for other organisations that would insist on teaching high standard of Sanskrit and promptly kicking out students who feel that Sanskrit isn't worth their time and diligence. It's never been otherwise: in order to learn something - anything - well, one has to commit to the task and work. That's not what's been happening in Samskrita Bharati camps, where Sanskrit is turned into a caricature of itself in order to artificially make is simple for the 'customers' who come with the consumerist expectation of 'learning' Sanskrit in 10 days.
