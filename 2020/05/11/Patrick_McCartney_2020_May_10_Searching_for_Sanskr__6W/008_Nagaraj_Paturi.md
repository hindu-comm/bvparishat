His articles connecting Sanskrit and Yoga in<https://www.utne.com/politics/imagining-sanskrit-land-zm0z17fzcmar>

  

and many more numerous articles of him show how singlemindedly he is striving to stop what he believes and is asking others to believe , a global supremacist agenda behind spread of Sanskrit , Yoga etc.

  

He repeatedly shared his concern about Modi government's plans through Ayush ministry to take over a huge share in the 'multitrilliondollar Wellness Industry, he cites<https://globalwellnessinstitute.org/press-room/statistics-and-facts/>for the figures about the size of the wellness industry.

  

He has been focusing on this Sanskrit Villages program from several years and says, he is calling the bluff of the program.
