"Reading McCrtney'sarticle, I find that he refers to me only once and gives a link to my article "Scope of Early Sanskrit Usage : A Wider Approach" and I don't see a direct quote from my article.": Precisely, Dr. Deshpande.

  

Incidentally, I happened to read your paper*Scope of Early Sanskrit Usage : A Wider Approach*on Jul 18, 2019, when it was [tweeted](https://twitter.com/tshrinivas/status/1151809037270487041?s=20) by Dr Shrinivas Tilak, and had responded to his tweet with a screenshot from a 2017 Feb presentation, on what appeared to be an inconsistency in Prof. Pollock's position on "Restrictions".
