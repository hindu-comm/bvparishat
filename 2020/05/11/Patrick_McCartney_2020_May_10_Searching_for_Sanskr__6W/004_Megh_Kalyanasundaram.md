Everything within " " in my first note in this thread is from[https://thewire.in/culture/](https://thewire.in/culture/)[india-census-sanskrit](https://thewire.in/culture/india-census-sanskrit), other than the emphasis (bold).Sentences that were not contiguousin the article have been separated by '...'.

  

The word "Both" in my second note should have been "All".
