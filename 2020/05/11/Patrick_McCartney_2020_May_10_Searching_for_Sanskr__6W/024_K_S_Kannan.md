Were it not for such easy and natural mutual comprehension,

would Sanskrit drama have employed a free commixture of Sanskrit and the Prakrit(s) ?

  

Secondly, had there been real contempt for the Prakrits/regional languages

as is made out to be by the modern linguists,

would Brahmin or aristocratic women too have deigned to speak the tongue?

  

In fact, what could contrarily be more surprising is the fact that  

it is in the regional languages that one can spot the differences between  

the registers of the "upper class" women and the lay.  

  

The Tamil or the Telugu spoken by a BrAhmaNa lady and by a S'Udra man/woman  

would show a great deal of difference.  

  

And on the contrary, I am not sure such a gulf exists between  

the Prakrit of Sakuntala and and the Prakrit of the sUta or the dauvArika or the bhaTa.

(Those who have specialised in the Prakrits should enlighten me if I am wrong).
