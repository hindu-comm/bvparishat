Further, if early writers in the regional languages have sometimes belittled Sanskrit

and upheld their own tongues, it is only with a justifiable sense of pride  

in one's own language or region.

  

All through, the two - the Sanskrit and the regional language -

had a sense of regard for each other :  

*ubhaya-bhAShA-vidvAn*-s adorned every king's court.

  

Sanskrit had a natural "upper hand", though,

for its enormity of literary production, and the variety of disciplines it pursued,

and its singular prestige of being a pan-Indian language

\- and all this for millennia.
