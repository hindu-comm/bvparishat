I said in my previous mail :

  

Many Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit speakers face criticisms and corrections from Vedic and Shaastric scholars who speak this traditionalversion of Sanskrit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

That said, the criticism against Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit too is unfair and irrational.

  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

Traditional Sanskrit scholars who correct Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit speakers to change their Sanskrit to a more traditional and idiomatic version have not only a right to do so but even have a responsibility to do so.

  

But what is annoying is the criticism of Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit by political shenanigans who have no such grounding in Sanskrit as the traditional Sanskrit scholars. Their expressed worry about Samskrita Bharati Sanskrit is not sincere. Their actual worry is about the booming success of the program across the globe, particularly among Indians in India and abroad who jumped at the opportunity with a feeling that they missed it earlier in their life. After learning Sanskrit, many of these Indian learners are proceeding to learn more from the Shaastras, Saahitya etc. After learning such things they are turning out to be powerful well grounded Indic warriors against these shenanigans. That is their worry.

  

Once on another list, this author posted the result of his long and hard worked research on Sanskrit villages created by Samskrita Bharati movement. He was mockingly pointing out the wrongs committed by the villagers in Sanskrit pronunciation etc. I responded saying that that is how Prakrits are formed. I said that Samskrita Bharati was reviving Sanskrit both in the Sanskrit / standard and Prakrit / dialect forms.
