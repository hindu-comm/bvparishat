As to objects and processes:

Bhartrhari posits four fundamental potencies:

*dis', sAdhana, kriyA,* and *kAla.*

*  
*

Of these the former two are "visible",

and the latter two are "invisible".

Space and Time are the first and the last

\- the veritable locus/coordinates of the middle pair.

  

And even among the middle two,

things (*sAdhana*-s) are but pictures of  

"frozen" moments of processes (*kriyA*).
