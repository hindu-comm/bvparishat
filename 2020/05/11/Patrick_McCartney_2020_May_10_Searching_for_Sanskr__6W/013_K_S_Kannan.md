And further, the tradition of writing commentaries in Sanskrit  

is an important point to be reckoned with.  

It is the Sanskrit commentaries on Sanskrit texts that elucidated  

what was stated in a compressed form in the original (or laden with suggestions)  

that carried the text through the length and breadth of the country.  

One must indeed trace the history of commentaries of Sanskrit texts in regional languages,  

and it will not be a surprise if the phenomenon is to be found  

only in recent centuries, by and large.

  

And equally importantly, commentaries on key texts were contributed  

from all parts and corners of the country, thus elucidating the text for all.  

And commentaries are being written even to this day.  

  

This dialectic - of all for one, one for all, thus tantamount to all for all -

should indeed make for an interesting and useful study.

  

Similarly, the distribution of manuscripts throughout the country  

\- if indeed one could draw a dynamic map of the same -  

should also tell interesting stories. So too the creation of  

vyAkaraNa and kos'a-literature, possibly from all parts of the country.

  

The issue of translations should also be similar.  

Into how many languages were Sanskrit texts translated, and whenfrom and wherefrom ?  

And especially into foreign languages (Arabic/Persian/Latin etc.).

  

IA could perhaps **add to its Projects Bank**, the generation of a  

diachronic and interrelating picture (a representative videograph if possible)  

of the creation and distribution of literature  

\- texts, commentaries, and translations - in manuscripts, and in various scripts.  

A three-dimensional moving map spanning millennia should delineate  

the panorama of the efflorescence of various branches of learning in India,  

very especially as a continuous tradition, rather than as growing by fits and starts, perhaps  

(guesstimates of manuscripts looted, lost, and burnt should also be included where possible).

  

The production of texts and glosses - of kAvya-s and s'Astra-s - and inscriptions  

should go to add a better picture. And too, how many vidyA-s and kalA-s existed/flourished

without much textual literature needs to be noted too.  

  

The fact remains that no country in the world produced as much literature as India did,

or as continuously as India did. Prof. Pollock too does not miss the point that  

the high prestige and vital role that English has today was shared  

by no other language in the world else than Sanskrit.
