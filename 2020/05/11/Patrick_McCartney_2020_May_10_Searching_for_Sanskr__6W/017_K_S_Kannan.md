And one could afford to take the "etymological" route as well:

*prakRtis saMskRtam, tatra bhavam prAkRtam ucyate* \|\|

  

But I am for the bidirectional causation.

  

To bring in a metaphor:

The *upavana* (*SaMskRta*) surpasses the *vana* (*PrAkRta*);

and the *vana* can surpass the *upavana* too:

while the former is easily discernible;

the latter is substantiated too - as by Kalidasa's  

*dUrIkRtAH khalu guNair*

*udyAna-latA vana-latAbhiH !*

*  
*

Lack of diligence morphs the cultivated into the raw, the deformed.

A sense of refinement elevates the raw into the cultured.

  

Both keep happening.  

*  
*
