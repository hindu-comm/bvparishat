\> "regardless of the theological presumption that the perceived*devabhasha*is eternal"

  

Whether this is from Prof. Deshpande or Patrick's own interpolation into the paraphrasing, to whomsoever it belongs to,

  

this appears to be a reference to S'abdanityatva.

  

1. The view /position of S'abdanityatva is not a theological position as stated here.

  

2. S'abdanityatva does not mean the nityatva of a language called Samskrita/ Sanskrit.

  

3. Nityatva of an entity does not mean no change in that entity with the passing of historical time.

  

4. Thus , even ifS'abdanityatva is interpreted as the nityatva of a language called Samskrita/ Sanskrit, it does not mean no change in the
language called Samskrita/ Sanskrit with the passing of historical time.
