Exactly , Prof. Kannan.

  

In all languages, Standard language/dialect/version \< --- \> Dialects is always a two way process. Sanskrit \<---> Prakrits is part of that universal phenomenon.

  

To treat Sanskrit and Prakrit as two different languages lead to many wrong interpretations in history.

  

During whatever period the Sanskrit-Prakrits language spoken, it was spoken in the major part of the Indic sub-continent. During that period, Prakrit speakers did not have to learn Sanskrit because Standard language/dialect/version \< --- \> Dialects are always mutually intelligible and the same was true with Sanskrit \<---> Prakrits too. Hence there is no question of Sanskrit being denied to the common masses of the entire part of the Indic sub-continent where Sanskrit \<---> Prakrits language was spoken. But the narrative of Sanskrit being denied to common masses is created and still continues to be spread.
