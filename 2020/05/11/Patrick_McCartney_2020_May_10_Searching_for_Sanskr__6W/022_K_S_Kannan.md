To corroborate Prof. Paturi's approach.

I have always taken the stand that Sanskrit and the Prakrit(s) are

no more than allotropes (as in Chemistry).

"The One" Sanskrit bodies itself forth as the various Prakrits and regional languages.

The MargI "appropriates" DesI, as it were,  

only to give it a deserved place in the grand scheme of things.

And the DesI betrays imprints of MargI

so as not to lack its Sophistication Quotient.

  

The MargI appeals to the masses with its tinges of DesI,

and the DesI gets its access to Royal Courts in its attunement to the MargI.

  

Those who are sensitive to, and have developed a taste for, the sanctified and the refined

are also prepared to work harder to acquire it - through prolonged and diligent cultivation;

comparable, again, to Kalidasa's:

*saMskAravatyeva girA manIShI*

*tayA sa **pUtash** ca **vibhUShitash** ca* \|\|

(*KumAra-sambhava* 1.28)
