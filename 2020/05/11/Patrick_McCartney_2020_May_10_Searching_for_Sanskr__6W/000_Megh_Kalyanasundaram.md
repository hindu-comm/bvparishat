"As far as historical linguists and sociologists are concerned, Sanskrit became a second language around the beginning of the post-Vedic Period (ca. 500 BCE). This is when it entered a post-vernacular phase, regardless of the theological presumption that the perceived*devabhasha*is eternal; as emeritus professor of Sanskrit, Madhav Deshpande,[explains](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/70440/items/1.0379841), it has undergone significant historical changes. ...**Essentially, people who identify as speakers of Sanskrit appear to be urban and educated**, which possibly **implies that the affiliation with Sanskrit is related in some way to at least some sort of Indian, if not, Hindu,** **nationalism**." \[Emphasis mine\]
