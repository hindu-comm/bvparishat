Dear Nagarajji,  

I will, but I do not know how to engage scholars in the research in the origin of word than with the structure of a word.

Possibly I have to create more literature. Let me see.

People are stuck with comparison not thinking that a word is created.  

The question is how does the brain synthesize information.

I will do in course of time.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
