Dear Dr. Irene,

"Process" is not news, but to develop linguistics through a sentence, in my view.

At least I have not seen linguistic literature besides our friend Bhartrhari more than a thousand years ago.

The science question is how does the brain create cognition. It is not philosophy or speculation.

please send any literature you know of or have written.

Best regards,

BM

  

PS. Word translation through object identification pervades in translating Indian texts, as I have

Indicated before. We may discuss in separate thread if you have literature.
