Dear friends,

As I had indicated a couple of weeks ago, I have been studying old indigenous material in Odia script to check

the object definition from an etymology point of view. The constructs in indigenous language appear to follow

grammar to be more metaphorical and condensed. The words seem to refer to processes than to objects.

This attracts me from the cognitive view of language creation.  

It appears that Prakrit family of languages could be well established in India much before the Vedic period.

Vedic Sansrit and eventually Classical Sanskrit literature use such metaphorical transformation and word  

formation through grammatical constructs. In the indigenous literature, it appears as oral and spontaneous.

This takes me to the neurology of acoustic rendering with built-in physiological economy in metabolism.

I thought to share. I have to experiment a lot more before I form an understanding.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
