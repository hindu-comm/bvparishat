In the Brahma sutra bhashya 2.3.43, Shankara has cited a passage as from the Atharva veda:  

  

तथा ह्येके शाखिनो दाशकितवादिभावं ब्रह्मण आमनन्त्याथर्वणिका ब्रह्मसूक्ते — ‘ ब्रह्म दाशा ब्रह्मदासाब्रह्मैवेमे कितवाः’ इत्यादिना ;  

  

No editor has cited the source of the passage, as far as I could search.

  

Could anyone help locating the passage?

  

Thanks
