From a beautiful ongoing series <https://www.prekshaa.in/reminiscences-pandurang-vaman-kane-part3> :  

  
"It turns out that long before commencing the writing of the volumes, PVK had a keen interest in all subjects related to Indian culture. He also had a deep understanding of the *dharma-shastra*s and matters related to Indian heritage. He was a master of the Sanskrit language and of his own interest, he had read the *Veda*s, *Upaniṣad*s, the Epics, the *Purāṇa*s, and other traditional works. But time and again, when PVK would come across the writing of some Western scholar or *soi-disant* Indologist on the subject of the *dharma-śāstra* that showed Indian culture in bad light, and his blood would boil. His anger would know no bounds when he came across writers who passed loose comments on the *dharma-śāstra*s or concluded that the Indian mind was uncivilized and nascent. At the dining table, he would express his anguish, “What does this fellow know about India and its heritage to comment this way? Where on earth does he find all these things in our *dharma-śāstra*s? What were people in Europe and the Americas doing when we already had a flourishing civilization in India?” Such constant episodes convinced him that he had to write something to shut the mouths of Western scholars who spewed absolute drivel about our ancient works. He made up his mind. “It is my duty to write this. I shall write about the *dharma-śāstra* in greater detail so that it will put all confusion to rest.” Doubtless he ended up becoming successful. A needle prick in the beginning sufficed to put the great mind on track to undertake the herculean task of compiling all the *dharma-śāstra*s and its commentaries right from Parāśara, Manu, and Yājñavalkya all the way until the day on which he wrote the specific chapter. This included the judgments passed by Indian courts and the *Privy Council*."
