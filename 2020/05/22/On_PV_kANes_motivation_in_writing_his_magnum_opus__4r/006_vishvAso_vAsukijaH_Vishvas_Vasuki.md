Epilogue in volume 5 part 2 does not describe motivation to my knowledge (just rechecked <https://archive.org/stream/HistoryOfDharmasastraancientAndMediaevalReligiousAndCivilLawV.5.2/Kane_A-History-of-Dharmasastra-v5-2_1962_djvu.txt> , please point out if you find it somewhere.)

    I had undertaken about 1911 an edition of the Vyavahara- 
    mayukha with explanatory notes on the advice of Prof. S. B. Bhan- 
    darkar who was one of the General Editors £ the Bombay Govt.'s 
    Sanskrit Series. But, owing to fluctuations in my own fortunes, I had 
    neglected the work and had almost decided to give up the under- 
    taking altogether. The Bombay Govt.'s Sanskrit Series came to be 
    transferred by Govt, to the Bhandarkar Oriental Besearch Institute 
    that had been started in Poona in 1917. The axitbonfaes of the 
    Institute pressed me to carry out my undertaking. I agreed and began 
    to read the vast Dharmalastra Literature for that purpose. The 
    edition of the VyavahSramayfikha of Nllakantba ( text based on 
    three printed editions and eight mss., an Introduction of 47 p«g« 
    and exhaustive notes) was published in 1926 by the Bhandarkar 
    Oriental Besearch Institute, Poona. In the bne Preface to tha 
    edition of 1926, I announced that I had undertaken to write 
    History of Dharmabatra Literature
