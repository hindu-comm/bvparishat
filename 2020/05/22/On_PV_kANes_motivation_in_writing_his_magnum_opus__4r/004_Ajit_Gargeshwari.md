Mahamahopadhya says he was trying to oscillate between two professions. Its is only by self sacrifice determination and not a care about ones own health that knowledge gets accumulated and great works are produced. He strove to make his work not just historical but a cultural encyclopedia as well. One may or may not agree with dates but his sound arguments and his ability to challenge views and write them in a logical manner for which he was trained are marks of a great scholar. Well versed in Sanskrit with a good command to write in English another asset.

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः।  
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे।।2.20।।
