Namaste

The following line is given by Swami Vidyaranya in his Panchadashi as well as in the Taittiriya Upanishad commentary, saying it is a smriti.  

  

ज्ञानादेव तु कैवल्यं प्राप्यते येन मुच्यते..  

  

  
Could anyone kindly trace the smriti text this verse is taken from?

  

Thanks and regards
