Namaste



As 'pika' became a disputed bird, here is one more composiiton from me , using a 'native bird'; of course drawing from a story in panchatantra.



Inspirational source is Prof.Deshpande ji, Jagannatha, R.Ganesh and other friends. The exercise of composing poetry is certainly stimulating and helps to recall Samskruth vocabulary . 



In this composition the focus is not on the 'color'; the focus is on ' disability to see from a given perspective; switch to another perspective' . and a 'debated theme'. The ' dark complexion ( krushnataa) ' is brought in as 'day-night vision capability.

Any overtones that may link this to vedanta debates is totally unintentional and unproductive in enjoying the powetry. '



काकोलूकाःप्रजल्पन्ति अस्ति नास्ति गभस्तिमान्

परस्परं गर्हयन्ति त्वमन्धस्त्वं न पश्यसि



kAkolUkaAH prajalpanti , asti nAsti gaBastimAn

parasparaM garhayanti tvamandhastvaM na paSyasi



The crows and owls herald: Sun is real, Sun is not real', by taking opposing views.

Each blame and howl at other : ' you are blind, you can't/ dont see' !
