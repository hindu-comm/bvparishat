स्वपक्षदोषाच्च॥ १० ॥ 2.1.10  

  

स्वपक्षदोषाच्च॥ २९ ॥ 2.1.29

  

In these two Brahma sutras, the topic is: One or more defects / inadequacies are there in both the parties: Vedantin and the Sankhya.
They can't be done away with and have to be put up with. In one case, parihara by the Vedantin is made in some other way.

  

This can be seen as a case of 'the pot calling the kettle black'.
