Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

  This is a very nice verse. Here is my description of an imagined debate between काक and कोकिल societies.

  

वायसा यत्र गर्जन्ति कोकिला मौनमाश्रिता: ।

वायसानां समाजेषु शृणुयात् को हि कोकिलम् ।।

  

"Where the crows are roaring, the cuckoos resort to silence. In the crowds of crows, who is going to listen to a cuckoo?"

  

With best wishes,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
