namaH sarvebhyo.

  

Just an observation, while we are on the topic of meter...



It seems this shloka

paravācyeṣu nipuṇaḥ sarvo bhavati sarvadā  
ātmavācyaṃ na jānīte jānann api vimuhyati  

reads a bit slightly off the standard shloka meter in the first pAda's in the 6th, 7th places.

  

Couldn't it have been more conforming like this...  

nipuṇaḥparavācyeṣu sarvo bhavati sarvadā

  
ātmavācyaṃ na jānīte jānann api vimuhyati  
  

Regards

Prabhu
