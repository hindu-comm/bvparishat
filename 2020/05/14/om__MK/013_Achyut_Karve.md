Dear Vidwans,

  

In the 20th century too learned women classical artists did not teach men music. Kesarbai Kerkar refused to teach music to males though men trained women in classical music.

  

There must be some physiological basis for this tradition rather than a bias of sex.

  

Westerners look at our culture from the point of view of how women are today treated in the west. What was the condition of women in the west during the middle ages?

  

The question to be raised is how did women look at themselves during the Vedic period and thereafter? Only an Indian man experiences what a marriage with an Indian women looks like. The Indian women is the best practioner of non violent resistance. No wonder that Mahatma Gandhi showed its power to the world.

  

The condition of women in Indian Society is best reflected in the speed with which the Indian woman transformed and continues to transform herself in Modern Society with minimal or no resistance from the community. More that women not being eligible to learn the Vedas the point is that women did not take upon themselves the responsibility of protecting the Vedas for which there may be many reasons.

  

All the vidhis conducted during the thread ceremony will surely reveal the importance of the samskara of the mother before the child is handed over to the Guru for further samskara.

  

Further one should not forget that the Vedas were protected through an oral tradition which meant that a Vaidic needs to daily recite all that he has committed to memory. This exercise takes away a major part of the day. The same is the case with many a classical musicians who have to commit to memory a few thousand compositions, perfect their recitation and then teach them to the succeeding generations for the tradition to live on uninterrupted. This job itself takes away a life time. Could women have been in a position to give somuch time? So to just say that women did not enjoy the same position as men in society is highly erroneous.

  

The Vedic tradition was a part of division of labour in Indian Society.
India did not have three estates aß the West had the nobility, the clergy and the rest of society as in France and other West European countries which had to be overthrown through a revolution.

  

With regard,

Achyut Karve.
