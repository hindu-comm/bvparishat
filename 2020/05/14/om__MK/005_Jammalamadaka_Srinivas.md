With due respect to scholars, I wish to put my understanding on this matter.

  

' स्त्रीशूद्रौ नाधीयेताम्' is the nishedha vAkya that forbids vedAdhyayana to stri and sudras.

The prerequisite to adhyayana is upanayanam. And among samskaras there are some samskaras that are not directed to females. They are chaulam and upanayanam. Amantraka chaulam is another vidhi for females. Vivaha is considered as upanayanam to females.

  

Namamsi,

Srinivas Jammalamadaka
