Dear Dr Irene,

  

   So far I have not come across any Hindi translation ofTattvabodhinī (bundled with SK and Bālamanoramā or on its own) and Subodhinī.

In the initial phase I did use VSK (the 4-volume edition from Varanasi, title page of 4th vol. attached), but after reading only the first few pages I left it, because I did not understand anything from it. It happened in about 1987 or so.

  

Later, from August 1987 I started studying Panini on my own directly in the Astadhyayi order of sutras.

  

I very well remember the help on the sutra "उरण् रपरः" that I got from the commentary बालमनोरमा, p.82, Vol.1 - "उः इति ऋ इत्यस्य षष्ठ्येकवचनम्।"

  

Then the idea clicked about theषष्ठी एकवचन form of पितृ, दातृ etc and understood why उः meansऋवर्णस्य here.

  

After having studied Panini, I started doing research onसरस्वतीकण्ठाभरण of भोजदेव., in which I was working on corrections in theसूत्रपाठ of ch.8 (dealing with the accent rules and Vedic morphology), which is highly corrupted. That time just for additional information I consulted VSK, Vol.4,Subodhinīcommentary and found it full of errors.

  

I am not aware, if any better edition of this 4th part has appeared at all.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
