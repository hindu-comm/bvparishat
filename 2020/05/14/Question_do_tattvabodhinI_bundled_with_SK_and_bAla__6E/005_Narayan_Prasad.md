\<\<I think there are other editions of the VSK that contain the Bālamanoramā, but I am not aware that this 4 volume edition containing both Bālamanoramā and Tattvabodhinī from MLBD has been reprinted with corrections.>\>  

  

Sir, actually I said: "That time just for additional information I consulted VSK, Vol.4,Subodhinīcommentary and found it full of errors. I am not aware, if any better edition of this 4th part has appeared at all."

I think, there are no Bālamanoramā and Tattvabodhinī commentaries on the accent and Vedic morphology. I did not mean to say that
Bālamanoramā and Tattvabodhinī commentaries were full of errors.
