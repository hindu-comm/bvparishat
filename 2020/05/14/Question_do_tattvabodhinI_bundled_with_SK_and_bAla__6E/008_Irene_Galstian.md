Namaste Rishiji.  
  
Thank you.  
This 10 volume set you're referring to I found already (will write to you directly).  
It's just that I was told by another person that Tattvabodhinī and Subodhinī were published in Hindi and decided to ask on BVP. But now I see that maybe not, otherwise quite a few people would've heard about this.
