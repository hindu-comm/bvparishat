Thank you, Prof. Paturi.

I do not doubt a bit that the *viṭa* type also existed in reality and I have not claimed anything else. As always with historical issues, we are dependent on the sources, which we have to integrate and interpret in a larger context. None of us lived in that time; there are no eyewitnesses. "The times they are a-changin'," sometimes even in India.

Sure. In Indian literature, the educated, urban courtesan is a recurring figure, and writers and poets certainly did not just think up this figure. Just think of Śyāmilaka's *Pādatāḍitaka*, where the Viṭa in his monologue tells very vividly of various courtesans. The much more frequent case of ordinary prostitutes has to be distinguished from this.  
  
With best regards,
