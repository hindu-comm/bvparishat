Dear Roland,

  

  My first encounter with this question was while reading Sten Konow's edition of the Karpūramañjari, as I was comparing it with other editions, and then Richard Solomon's critique of Konow's edition came out. I saw both of these references in your bibliography. I had hypothetically suggested that the stereotypicalassignment of different originally regional Prakrits to different roles in the Sanskrit dramas had something to do with the changing political fortunes of these different regions. Assuming that this assignment comes after the fall of the Magadhan empire of the Mauryas and Shungas, and during the rise of the Satavahanas, treating the Maharashtri Prakrit as the poetic Prakrit par excellence and relegating the Magadhi to comic roles like that of the Śakāra in the Mr̥cchakaṭika would make sense. But this is only a hypothesis. Thanks for sharing your paper. With best wishes,
