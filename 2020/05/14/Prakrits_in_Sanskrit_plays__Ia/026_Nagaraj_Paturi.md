Dear Dr Roland Steiner,

  

First let me apologize for spelling your name wrongly in my earlier mail.

  

My response about the courtesan -deva dasi women was based on your concluding statement:

I was saying that both categories of women were / are realities.

Another point not related to or in response to Dr Steiner's paper but related to to the female characters covered by that is the stereotyping about the Courtesan - Deva Dasi community that continues among the urban educated Indians and is used for political manipulation for national and international anti-Indic consumption.

  

One example is the statements by Sri T M Krishna about the legendary Carnatic singer Bharata Ratna M S Subbulakshmi amma. He says that she had to undergo a lot of agony to get Brahminised to get acceptability.

  

He says, "One can hear MS Subbulakshmi’s old songs on YouTube. The music is free-spirited and electrifying and *one feels*

*like one is listening to a rock star*. The music rendered by her *after undergoing cultural and social transformation* is

equally fascinating to hear, but ***one notices the sorrow behind her voice***,”

  

That analogy toa rock star itself shows the cultural uprootedness of the speaker. How can a Carnatic music singer well rooted and trained right from her childhood in that tradition have the features of a totally different cultural tradition of a rock star. Is he misunderstanding/ deliberately misinterpreting the juvenile vibrancy and enthusiasm getting transformed into a more mature and fulfilled expression that comes by age, experience and humility born of success characteristic of great personalities, spiritual attainment born of tapas in a true tapasvinias a forced transformation for acceptability ?

  

The scholarly Sanskritic shaastric training from very early childhood among the courtesan-devadasi community is centuries if not millennia old. In an eleventh century classical Telugu narrative poem, the poet while describing the court in which his king requested him to compose the poem, calls it vidyaavilaasagoshThiand describes the participation of vilaasinis along with taarkikas, vaiyaakaraNas, pauraaNikas, kavis etc. in that scholarly court.

  

During the Tanjore Nayaka rule of the 17th century most of the court-poetesses hailed from that community, had titles such as chaturvidhakavitaavis'aarada, ashTabhaashaavis'aarada , sadyass'ataikaprabandhaghaTanaalekhinee etc. Got felicitated with kanakaabhishekas etc. by the kings. Composed poetr in Sanskrit, performed avadhaanas etc. in Sanskrit, argued with male, mostly Brahmin, scholars in Sanskrit.

  

Within the Cortesan-Devadasicommunity, the Devadasi community in particular had a greater spiritual learning and practice.

  

These T M Krishnas do not have a clue to such roots of our culture and society.
