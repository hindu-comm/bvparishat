Dear Suresh,

  

  I tend to agree with Steve Collins' view. The linguistic features of Pali don't agree with what we know from Magadha in Ashokan inscriptions or later descriptions of Magadhi Prakrit, nor does it agree with Ardhamāgadhī. There is no voicing of the medial voiceless stops, loss of medial voiced stops, no change of r>l, masc. nominative sg ending in e, and so many differences. On the other hand, Pali agrees more with the linguistic features of Ashokan inscriptions in Girnar.
The migration of Buddhism to Sri Lanka is said to have happened from the west coast, and the Sinhala language also is closer to western Indo-Aryan than eastern Indo-Aryan. However, in some rare passages in the Sutta Nipāta, there are some frozen traces of nominatives in e, and this may suggest that some original eastern dialect was then rendered into a western dialect as it was transported to Sri Lanka. Pali is far too closer to Sanskrit as compared to any other known middle Indic language. This closeness is seen more in the western Ashokan dialects.
That is my general understanding, but this is a somewhat disputed subject.
