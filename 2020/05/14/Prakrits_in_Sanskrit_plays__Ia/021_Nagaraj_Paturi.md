Dr Ronald Steiner,

  

I admire your highly balanced and nuanced analysis, particularly the way you recognize the nuanced combinations of the three categorizations and their three different bases etc.

  

But let me tell you that vita being made to speak Sanskrit and being an informed connoisseur of arts etc. too is part of cultural realism.

  

Even the courtesan s'ringaarawomen being highly learned in Sanskrit, shaastras etc. is also part of cultural realism. I was eye witness to a surviving Deva Daasi woman as recently as in 1990s deriving Sanskrit words quoting Ashtaadhyaayee sutras and explaining her choice of hastasetc. quoting profusely from Sanskrit works and explaining them in a shaastric way.

  

Congratulations again for an intricate study.
