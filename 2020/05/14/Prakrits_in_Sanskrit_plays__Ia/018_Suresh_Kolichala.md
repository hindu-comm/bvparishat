Dear Sri Paturiji,

  

Well, I saw your correction only after I clicked 'Send' on my lengthy reply :-). Anyways, your post provoked me enough to dust off my laziness to post on this august forum.

  

I also appreciate if you can comment on my arguments for deriving Tenugu from a more ancientTeliṅgu/Teluṅgu.

  

Thanks,

Suresh.
