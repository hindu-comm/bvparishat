Dear Sri Radhakrishnanji,

  

I just want to bring it to your notice that Sri. Vakulabhushana (Jaggu Alvar Iyangar), a reputed writer of merit, who worte more than twenty two plays in chaste classical Sanskrit, Copiously following the rules of dramaturgy, poetics and grammar has used prakirt in many of his dramas. As a nonagenarian, he was with us even in the last decade of twentieth century. Though he hailed from Melukote, a great place of pilgrimage, he spent his last year's in Bangalore. I had the good fortune of gaining his affection. Apart from plays, he has many more works in Sanskrit to his credit.

  

With regards

Ganesh
