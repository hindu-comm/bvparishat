Dear Madhav,  
  
Thank you very much for your important comments. The fact that Māhārāṣṭrī is regarded as Prakrit par excellence could also have a further reason. The oldest Prakrit collection of verses, Hāla's *Sattasaï*, is written in pure Māhārāṣṭrī. Luigia Nitti-Dolci has shown "that the last three books (X-XII) of Vararuci's grammar dealing with Paiśācī, Māgadhī, and Śaurasenī are additions of later authors" and "that Vararuci has apparently based his sketchy description of Māhārāṣṭrī on a collection of Gāthās which was very similar to the transmitted *Sattasai*" (see fn. 9 \[p. 65\] of my 2001 paper). One could, therefore, assume that it is a kind of text grammar, namely of an anthology of verses in Māhārāṣṭrī. From the point of view of the later grammarians who followed Vararuci, Māhārāṣṭrī is, therefore, the "principal Prakrit", which in their description forms the basis of all other Prakrits.  
  
With best wishes,  
Roland
