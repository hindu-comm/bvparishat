\> Thanks  
  
I'm afraid I gave you a wrong explanation, as I've just realized. In  
Oberlies's text "Nebenmundarten" does not mean "secondary dialects,"  
but rather "parallel dialects", which have developed from Indo-Iranian  
"alongside" ("neben") the main dialect or independently of it. My  
apologies.
