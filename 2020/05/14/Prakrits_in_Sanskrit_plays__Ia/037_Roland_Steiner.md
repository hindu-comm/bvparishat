Dear Madhav,

  
  
  
\> and it could be the political dominance of the Sātavāhanas and or  

\> the popularity of Hāla's \*Sattasai\*

  
  
\> This may not be only the poetic excellence of Vaidarbhī, but also the prominence of the Sātavāhanas, perhaps as  
\> patrons of Sanskrit poetry.   
  

Both seem plausible to me. Unfortunately, we cannot get beyond well-founded hypotheses here.  
  
Best,  
Roland
