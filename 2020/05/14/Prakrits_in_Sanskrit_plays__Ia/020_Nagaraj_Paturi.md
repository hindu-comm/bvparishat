Very interesting Sri Kolichala-ji.

  

This goes with the l --> n derivation path than the n --> l found in deriving from ten = south popular among modern Telugu linguists.

  

There are many conjectures such as trikalinga --> tialinga --> telinga --- \> telugu ( Dr Puccaa Parabrahma Shastry , older books of him ) . (He recently before his recent sad demise , came up with a derivation from tella benna = Godavari river in contrast to nalla benna = Krishna river )

  

Some very funny conjectures such as trinaga -- \> tenugu ---> telugu

  

and so on.

  

But you site this inscription which is a more reliable way than the others mentioned above.
