Very interesting discussions in this thread.

  

"*There is too, the reference to Naishadhiya Carita 10.34*

*where it is shown that Sanskrit served as a link language.*"

  

I think ever since communication between the learned began on a pan India basis, Sanskrit must have functioned as the primary link language. Prakrits had their geographical limitations. Different parts of India had different Prakrits some of which must have been mutually unintelligible. And in some parts like south India, Prakrits were not spoken as the first language. An Adi Shankara from Kerala would definitely choose Sanskrit for debating with a Mandana Mishra or conversing with learned people in Kashmir.

I think Sanskrit remained as a vibrant link language till relatively recently when it was replaced by English. Even though the Muslim rulers used Persian as the court language, I think it did not diminish Sanskrit’s position as the primary pan Indian link language of the learned.

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
