Mandikal Ramasastri (1849-1929) wrote several Sanskrit works,

one of them being a 10-Act drama called *BhaimI-pariNaya-nATaka*

(abridged and translated by me into Kannada and English with exhaustive Notes,

and published by Bangalore University 2005, 2008, 2012(reprint)).  

There are some Prakrit dialogues in the play.

  

The introductory note says :

दृढाऽनभ्यस्त-प्राकृत-भाषाणां पठितॄणाम् *सौकर्यार्थं*  

प्राकृत-भाषाम् अधः-प्रदर्शित-तिर्यग्-रेखाधस्स्थले विलिख्य,  

उपरि संस्कृत-भाषा-मात्रम् व्यलेखि ।

  

किञ्च-  

"क्वचिच्च देवी-गणिका-मन्त्रि-राजादि-योषिताम् ।

योगिन्यप्सरसां शिल्पकारिण्या अपि संस्कृतम् ॥

\- **इति शास्त्र**मनुसृत्य ...

  

So the bar on Sanskrit was not a very strict one,  

at least, or perhaps even in, Sanskrit plays.  

(Only the *naTI, ceTa, bAla,* and *vyAdha*

speak in Prakrit in the play).  

  

When Sanskrit plays began to get printed,  

relegating Prakrit to footnotes has been fairly common  

as/where the Prakrit is not grasped.
