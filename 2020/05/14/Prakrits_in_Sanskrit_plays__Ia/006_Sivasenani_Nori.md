Sir

  

Telugu and Tenugu are equivalent though the former is more popular.

  

I am speculating here, but I wonder if a) both these are derived from the original form teluMgu (తెలుంగు, तेलुंगु - the ए ki maatraa being short) and b) whether this would also explain the family name Telang in Maharashtra and the name of the present State, Telangana (one explanation is trilinga-deSam —> Trailinga -- \> Tailang -- \> Telang).

  

I never thought about the etymology of acca (or heard of your suggestion) but your suggestion seems very plausible. Also, off-hand I cannot think of any other word in Telugu for 'pure' or 'unmixed' which is not of Sanskrit origin.

  

Regards

Senani
