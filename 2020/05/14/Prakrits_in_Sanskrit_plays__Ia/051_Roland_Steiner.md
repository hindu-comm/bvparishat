\> I know 'Mundart' is 'patois' or 'vernacular'. What would be 'Nebenmundart'  
\> - neighboring vernaculars? adstrates?  
  

"Mundart" here is another word for "dialect".  
  
"Nebenmundarten" (plural of "Nebenmundart") are **secondary dialects** that have developed from the **main dialect**.  
  
Best wishes,
