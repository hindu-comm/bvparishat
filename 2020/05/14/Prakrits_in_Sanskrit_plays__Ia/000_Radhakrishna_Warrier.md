There are characters in many Sanskrit plays who speak Prakrit. I was told that the Prakrits used in Sanskrit drama could be

-   the spoken languages of the time and place of the playwright or the
    intended audience -   the spoken languages of a previous era the feel of which the
    playwright wants to create for the viewer -   generated from Sanskrit by means of some formula  
      

Have these three varieties of Prakrits been identified by experts in pre modern Sanskrit Drama? 

I was told that there were Sanskrit plays written in medieval Kerala that included Prakrit speaking characters. I am also told that these Prakrits were formula generated and represented the spoken language of no place or times. Obviously, the majority of the population in Kerala did not speak any variety of Prakrit as their mother tongue at any time.
