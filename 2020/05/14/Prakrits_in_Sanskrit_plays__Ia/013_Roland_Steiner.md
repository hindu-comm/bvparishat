As a complement to the worth reading chapter of Prof. Deshpande's book from 1979, I have attached my 2004 paper "Female Characters and Female Audiences. Remarks on Female Roles in the Indian Dramaturgic Tradition", which also deals with the use of Sanskrit and Prakrit in the theatrical tradition.  
  
Best,
