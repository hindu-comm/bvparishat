Acca Tenugu is only one version. It cam /is also be called Acca Telugu.

  

Tenugu/Telugu are alternate forms.

  

The form Tenugu is found in older literary works than the form Telugu. Nannaya (1048-1062) and Nannechodudu (the late eleventh and the early twelfth century) use the form Tenugu in their works. In later works, both forms Tenugu and Telugu are found.

  

But there is agreement among scholars with regard to Telugu being derived from Tenugu. Modern linguists derive Telugu from Tenugu which they derive from the Dravidian ten = south. (which Dravidian speaker called the Telugu people as southern is not answered by thersescholars. There are no Dravidians to the north of the Telugu speakingarea. Telugu speakers can't describe themselves as the southern unless they were telling about themselves to the northern non-Dravidian speakers in a Dravidian language. )

  

Traditional scholars believe that Tenugu is derived from Telugu which in turn is derived from Trilinga the description of the Telugu speaking region found in older works than Nannaya and Nannechodudu but written in Sanskrit. (The Svopajna or Helaraja commentary I don't remember exactly , while explaining parvataadadaagamam labdhvaa in Vaakyapadeeyam, says trilingaparvataikades'a s'reeparvataaditi )

Acca Tenugu does not refer to non-Sanskrit Telugu. It refers to non-Tatsama Telugu. It includesDes'ya and Tadbhava words of Telugu.

  

The derivation of the word acca from the Sanskrit/ Prakrit Acchaa is very well known. Acca Tenugu/Acca Telugu words are also called Aacchika words.

  

Chinnaya Suri who has a whole chapter , pariccheda on Aacchika /Acca tenugu /Acca Telugu words uses the word "Accha" only in reference to these words.

  

Aacchika paricchedamu begins with the definition of Accha only. Deerghaantasof Sanskrit ? prakrit changing into hrasvaantas in Telugu is a norm in Telugu. So Accha \< Acchaa is a great possibility.
