In Telugu literature, many kavis are described as knowing ashTapraakrits, for the last thousand years or so. So there would be more to 'formula generation' than the label would initially suggest, as in these poets writing grammatical Prakrit. If you literally apply it, even Sanskrit could be described like that; as could be the English of an earlier generation of clerks, (or present day contact center workers), who could write letters (emails) in English but not really speak (or understand) English. We have another contemporary emerging example. Three decades ago, Singlish was almost a derogatory reference to the pidgin English mixed with Malay and Chinese heard in Singapore. Now they are teaching it formally, or in a formulaic fashion.

  

This practice of inserting Prakrit into a poetic work is not medieval either. Visvanatha Satyanarayana garu, a great Telugu poet of the last century wrote a short novel called Haa Haa Hoo Hoo, wherein a Gandharva called Haa Haa Hoo Hoo lands in London, tired. He speaks Prakrit. So there are a few lines penned in Prakrit in the initial part, before the author says, for readers' sake only the Telugu equivalent of what the Gandharva said would be given going forward.

  

Literature need not be based only on languages spoken as mother tongue by a large native population; it could be based on exposure to even a few speakers of a language. For instance Swathi Thirunal wrote songs in eight languages, including Telugu and Hindi, in his short life. Some of these, conceivably, were not the mother tongues of any significant part of population in Kerala two centuries ago.In fact most of Sanskrit literature in the last few centuries is of the same category. Surprisingly there is another member of that category - acca tenugu, ie pure Telugu or only Telugu, ie without words borrowed from Sanskrit. There are kaavyas /works in acca tenugu, as late as till a hundred years ago, but most Telugu readers cannot fully comprehend those kaavyas!

  

When we find evidence of trade with Roman empire in South India in pre-Christian times, it is perfectly plausible that a number of speakers of Prakrits like Sauraseni would have frequented Kerala and that scholars from Kerala would have travelled to places like Kanchi and Varanasi where many Prakrits were spoken. Then we had the spread of Buddhism and Jainism with their scriptures in Pali and Ardhamagadhi, and the resultant exposure and interaction.

  

So the framework may not be an exhaustive one.
