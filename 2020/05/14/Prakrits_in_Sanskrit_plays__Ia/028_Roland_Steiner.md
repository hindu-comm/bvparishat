Allow me to add a brief addition. The fact that the various typified roles of classical Indian drama are assigned to different languages, with which a specific status is associated, has an important literary function and is certainly not completely independent of actual social conditions. However, one should not confuse a classical Indian play with a historical report or reportage. The literary genre prescribes the use of a fixed repertoire of languages that are more or less rigidly assigned to stereotypical characters or roles. The earliest surviving Sanskrit/Prakrit plays probably date from the 1st or 2nd century, and even then the use of different languages resembles what has become standard in later plays, which in principle has not changed until today. Within this framework, a fixed set of *literary* Prakrits has been used for many centuries up to the present day. The natural predecessors of these literary Prakrits had ceased to be spoken languages (in the sense of a "first, indigenous language") by the first half of the first millennium at the latest (the Apabhraṃśa tradition begins around the middle of the 1st millennium). This is one of the reasons why Prakrit grammars had become necessary for learning these Prakrits (see the attached paper; the earliest surviving Prakrit grammar (Vararuci) is perhaps from the 3rd or 4th century).  
  
That the literary dramatic Prakrits are to a certain extent artificial languages can also be seen from the fact that the original regional references no longer play any role in the plays. For example, Śaurasenī was originally based in Śūrasena (the area around Mathurā), but in the plays, it is largely "retranslated" from Sanskrit. The other dramatic Prakrits, such as Māgadhī, are also no longer associated with their original regions but only serve defined literary functions within the genre. For example, Māhārāṣṭrī is the typical Prakrit for verses sung by otherwise Śaurasenī speaking women.  
  
In one of the dramas attributed to Aśvaghoṣa, the Buddha and his disciples Śāriputra, Maudgalyāyana, and Kauṇḍinya speak Sanskrit, which, of course, does not mean that this reflects a historical reality but is due to the literary genre.  
  
It is quite another thing when Bilhaṇa (11th cent.) describes the capital Pravarapura (Śrīnagar) of his native Kashmir in an autobiographical section of his *Vikramāṅkadevacarita*:  
  
brūmaḥ sārasvatakulabhuvaḥ kiṃ nidheḥ kautukānāṃ  
tasyānekādbhutaguṇakathākīrṇakarṇāmṛtasya /  
**yatra strīṇām api** kim aparaṃ **janmabhāṣāvad eva  
pratyāvāsaṃ vilasati vacaḥ saṃskṛtaṃ prākṛtaṃ ca** // 18.6 //  
  
Of course, one cannot rule out that Bilhaṇa may have exaggerated a bit here, but it is also clear that he claims to describe reality. And obviously he (having led a wandering life far from his homeland for a long time and being the court poet and first scholar of the Cāḷukya King Vikramāditya VI) considered the fact that in Pravarapura "in every house" even women spoke Sanskrit and Prakrit "like mother tongues" to be something worth reporting.  
  
Kind regards,
