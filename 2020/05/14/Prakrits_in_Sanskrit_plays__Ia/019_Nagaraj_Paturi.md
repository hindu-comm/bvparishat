Let me use a term, my coinage, LinguisticRealism to give you the reason why the Sanskrit plays adopt the Sanskrit - Prakrit two language use. We see standard form of a language and dialects of that language in narrative literature fiction, drama etc. used all over the world. Do they or did they do it because they all read Natya Shastra and wanted to follow its instruction ? This standard form -dialects use is found even today in all modern regional Indian narrative literary works, theatrical or fictional , in films in various Indian languages. Can we say that all these follow the instructions from Natya Shastra ?

  

If we agree that they do so only to be realistic in terms of language use of the people that are represented in their works, we can and should apply the same logic to the Sanskrit plays too.

  

If Natya Shastra is instructing this to be done, it is also for this purpose of realism which the book reflects by calling Natya as lokavrittaanukaraNam. In fact Natya Shastra'sinstruction does not stop with suggestion to include Prakrits, it suggests to include various regional languages (Des'a Bhashas) like Tamil too.

  

When we say that the two language forms model is done for realism, it does not mean that the poet was accurately representing the languages used in his space and time. It does not happen even contemporary narrative literature or films. Both the premodern Sanskrit plays and the contemporary narrative literature and films reflect the reality that there is a use of two language forms, the standard/ elite and the dialect. For example, the early modern Telugu plays used the classical Telugu , laakshaNikabhaashaa, which was the standard form before the success of the spoken language movement and dialects , that were ,during those days, called graamyamu. This is again for linguistic realism, though classical Telugu was not really spoken by any group of Telugu speakers.

  

Once we recognize this point of linguistic realism, we realise that there is no need for looking for some special reasons for the inclusion of Prakrits either by the plays or by Natya Shastra.
