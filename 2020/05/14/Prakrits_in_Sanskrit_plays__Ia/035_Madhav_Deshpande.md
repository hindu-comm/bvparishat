Dear Roland,

  

  Your explanation of why the Mahārāṣṭrī Prakrit emerged in the Prakrit grammars as the primary Prakrit and "the basis of all other Prakrits" as you say makes sense to me. In terms of the historical development of sound changes as we understand today and in terms of the geographical distribution of the Prakrits, it would seem more natural to have the descriptive sequence Sanskrit>Śaurasenī>Mahārāsṭrī, while the Prakrit grammars adopt the sequence Sanskrit>Mahārāṣṭrī>all other Prakrits. So, there must be some dominant reason to treat Mahārāṣṭrī as the primary Prakrit, and it could be the political dominance of the Sātavāhanas and or the popularity of Hāla's *Sattasai*. This also parallels in some interesting way the primacy of the poetic style described as *Vaidarbhī*which Vāmana calls possessing all poetic virtues \[*samagraguṇā*\], in comparison with *Gaudī* and *Pāñcālī*.
This may not be only the poetic excellence of Vaidarbhī, but also the prominence of the Sātavāhanas, perhaps as patrons of Sanskrit poetry.
Again, I am speaking of possible hypothetical explanations. Best,
