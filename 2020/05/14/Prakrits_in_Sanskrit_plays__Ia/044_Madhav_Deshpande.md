Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

I am not the primary researcher on the origin of Pali. For the best recent work on this topic, let me refer you to articles by three leading scholars in the field, namely, Oskar von Hinuber, K. R. Norman and Steve Collins. They don't completely agree with each other, but offer insights into the problems of the early oral and orthographic transmission of the Buddhist scriptures in ancient India and Sri Lanka. Unlike the frozen languages seen in the Ashokan inscriptions, Pāli as we have it is what is the result of a long oral and orthographic transmission that reaches its fixed written form only in 1200 A.D. You can download these three articles with this download link.
