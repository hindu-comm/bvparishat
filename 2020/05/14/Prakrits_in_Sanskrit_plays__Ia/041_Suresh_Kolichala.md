Dear Madhav, Roland and others,

  

Thanks for very insightful discussion on Prakrits. I have a question regarding Pāḷi/Pāli: is there a consensus on the status ofPāḷi as a spoken dialect? I was somehow under the impression thatPali language was same as thevernacular spoken in the ancient kingdom of Magadha (perhaps closely related to the language that the Buddha himself spoke). I was surprised to read Steven Collins' paper on*What Is Literature in Pali,*where heregards Pali to have originated from a northwestern dialect, rather than an eastern one. Is it generally accepted? I appreciate your responses.

  

Regards,

Suresh.
