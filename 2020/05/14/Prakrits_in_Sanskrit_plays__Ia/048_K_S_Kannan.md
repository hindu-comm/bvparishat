Apropos the verse of Bilhana writing about  

the multilingual learnedness of the ladies in Kashmir.

  

Has the verse been discussed in greater detail in respect of  

\(a\) the *janma-bhASha* being (equally?) different from Sanskrit and Prakrit, and especially  

\(b\) Prakrit then/there being no spoken tongue too, and

\(c\) the *janma-bhASha* of Kashmiris not labelled a Prakrit ?

  

And if only *just the educated* Indians do today  

what ordinary Kashmiri womenfolk - of ***every*** household (*praty-AvAsam*) - did then :  

learn Sanskrit and (some) Prakrit(s) along with their *janma-bhASha,*

there would be a greater awareness of our heritage,

and a different orientation in their thinking altogether!
