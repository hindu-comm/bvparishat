I am afraid this is not correct. There is no agreement among the linguists with regard to the etymology of the word Telugu/Tenugu. In fact, there is more comparative evidence and we can make a more compelling linguistic argument for the for the derivation of the word Tenugu from a more ancient Teliṅgu/Teluṅgu.

  

Here are some quick arguments:  
1. The earliest mention of Tilinga (Trilinga?) forthe current Telugu speaking regions is found in the purple plates of Ganga king dated 647 CE.

2\. Of course, there is some reference to Trilingon in Ptolemy's documents (1st CE), but we don't know what region/area it refers to. Some speculated

3\. Kalhana of 11th C. CE from Kashmir while referring to *pañca drāviḍa* used Tailaṅgaamong the five regions:

4\. The Coḻa inscriptions from 1012-13 CE refers to a place as Teluṅgakulakālapuram (ref: inscriptions of Pudukkottai State). The name was based on the title Teluṅgakulakāla for Cōḻa Rajaraja I.  

  

I believe Telinga/Tailinga/Telungu/Telugu referred to a set of people, just as Kalinga. To me,Kalinga andTelinga are a pair of two related regions, just as the Kosalaand Tosala were. Furthermore, if you consider -ṅgu, which is a plural suffix in languages such as Gondi, we may be able to explain these words originally as aas names of the ancient tribes.
