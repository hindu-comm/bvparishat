An Indic renaissance is unsustainable without reviving Indic thought which supports all Indic arts, sciences, technology and culture. As a step towards this revival, MIT-ADT School of Vedic Sciences Pune and Indic Academy are teaming up to provide a 3-week online webinar course by a renowned traditional scholar and contemporary thinker, Prof. Shrinivasa Varakhedi.

  

This course is a primer for modern professionals, intellectuals and young Sanskrit scholars on India’s intellectual tradition and its relevance for future innovation. It provides a novel meta-perspective on Indic knowledge systems beyond what is traditionally offered in Shaastra education.

  

It covers Indic models of cognition, communication and cosmology culled from Nyaaya, Vaisheshika, Saankhya, Vyaakarana and Mimaamsa systems and their unique contributions.
