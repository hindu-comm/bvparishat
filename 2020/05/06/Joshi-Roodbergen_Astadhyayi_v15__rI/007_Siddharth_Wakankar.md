I think,in the present situation,the best way is to write to either Prof. Ashok Aklujkar or Prof.Madhav Deshpande or Prof. Saroja Bhate as Prof.Bhagyalata Pataskar did not oblige us last time..These senior scholars were very close to Prof.S.D.Joshi.

  

Best of luck in your search.  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
