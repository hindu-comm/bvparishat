Thank you, Prof Wakankar and Prof Deshpande.

  

Right now, we've got v14 already purchased and awaiting courier collection to travel to the UK. Once it gets here, I'll scan it, so that others on this thread, who have the first 13 volumes, can add to their collections. If you have some of the first 13 volumes as PDFs but can't find others, please send a private message, since this is an already solved problem.

  

However, if any of the scholars mentioned above could approach Prof Joshi's daughter and find out about the mysterious v15, the matter would be clarified for all of us. It's possible, for example, that this volume exists somewhere as manuscripts and notes but not (yet) as a published book.

  

Irene
