Namaste Mr Prasad,  
  
If you look at the vols 1-13, you'll see that the pratyaya section  
(adh 3-5), the first 3 pādas of adh6, and adh 8 weren't covered, so  
the beginning of aṅga section, i.e. 6.4 (v9) starts after the end of  
the 4th pāda of adh 2 (v8). Towards the end of Prof Joshi's life, he  
and Prof Roodbergen undertook the task of completing the work - so I'm  
told. Thus, v14 covers 4.1.176-5.4.160 (taddhita), but I'm not sure  
what v15, if it exists, would cover. I suspect that the person who  
knows exactly what happened would be Prof Pataskar, whom Prof Wakankar  
knows well, and who is a BVP member - but she doesn't come to BVP, I  
think.  
  
If I find out more, I'll keep you posted, of course. If you find out  
more, please tell me too.  
  
Best wishes,  
Irene
