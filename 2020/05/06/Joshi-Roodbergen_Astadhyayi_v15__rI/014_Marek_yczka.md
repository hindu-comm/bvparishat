Dear Irene,

please find the pictures of the books attached. That's proof I can give you just now ;-) I will also scan thevolume "15" ASAP. There is one thing more, you can read on the book jacket about Roodbergen'sstory. I know it from Director of Vaidika Samshodhana Mandala in Pune. She told me that the last volume was...too slim to be published by Sahitya Akademi, so Prof. Roodbergen asked her to completethe series in Pune, not in Delhi. In 2012 that publisher also kindly published the appendix by J.A.F. Roodbergen - "The Astadhyayi of Panini. A Brief Exposition"...  
  

Kind regards,

Marek
