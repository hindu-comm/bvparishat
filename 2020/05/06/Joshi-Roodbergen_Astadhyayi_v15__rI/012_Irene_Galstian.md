Dear Marek,

  

Thank you for the post. I've been thinking about your suggestion that Roodbergen's book on feminine suffixes is the v.15.

Of course, I would be grateful for a scan if that wouldn't inconvenience you, but at the same time I would be surprised if this book is really the v.15 of Joshi-Roodbergen series.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
