Has anyone yet tried this?

I'll like to hear experiences, either here or on Github.

That may help me improve it, add features, etc.

We may then create a video guide for others.

Since I'm on Mac OS, I can't know how it interacts with Windows. Although this is platform-independent script, it must work.  

If anyone faces errors on Windows, please let me know; I may just have to correct some path, etc.
