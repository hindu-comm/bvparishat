Namaste,

  

I am new to this discussion. I am experienced in ML(NLP using spacy) & achieved 78% accuracy in Titanic dataset at Kaggle. Can you please guide me to contribute in your project. I am good at python and Anaconda. I am using Jupyter Notebook for your Git Repository. If any issue comes, I will ask you for your help.

  

Regards

Prashant
