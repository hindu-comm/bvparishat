Namaste to all group members,

  

The re-telecast of Ramayan and Mahabharat led me to these questions:

  

1\) Whenfighting with bows and arrows, how far did people stand from one another in the battle ground ?

2\) How soon the other had to shoot his arrow so as to intercept the arrow of his enemy?

3\) How much time did the arrow to take to hit the person targeted if no arrows intercepted it?  
4) What may have been the velocity of an ordinary arrows or a "divyaastra"?  
5) How far could an ordinary arrow or a "divyaastra"go?  
  
regards,

Prakash Raj Pandey
