Remembering a Terrified Student:

  

During my early days of teaching Sanskrit at the University of Michigan, a student wrote a letter to me: "Dear Professor, I am terrified in your class that you will ask me a question or ask me to compose a sentence in Sanskrit. I cannot sleep for three nights before your class and three nights after your class. It is a dead language anyway. Why do you care to make us compose sentences in a dead language?"
