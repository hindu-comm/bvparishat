In India, the situation is different in many ways.

  

In many BoS meetings, one of the the first thing you are reminded is -  

take note, the number of students who take Sanskrit is steadily dwindling.

So whatever text or syllabus may be prescribed,  

ensure that students do not find it difficult to get passing marks!

  

Always remember, there are many students from villages  

who have no good background in Sanskrit  

(and in any subject for that matter).

Social justice cannot be compromised.  

  

As to the situation in the class.  

Teaching students the right tools to be used is one thing  

that makes learning Sanskrit less difficult.  

And the second, and the more important, thing is to  

make them listen to spoken (explanatory) Sanskrit  

for at least 5 to 10 minutes in every class.  

  

The efforts and methods of Samskrita Bharati elevate the scheme  

to indeed a higher level making Sanskrit a full-fledged **live** medium.

Those who listen to the spontaneous Sanskrit there

cease to think that Sanskrit is dead, and **become alive to  
**

**the lively and lovely ideas** therein.
