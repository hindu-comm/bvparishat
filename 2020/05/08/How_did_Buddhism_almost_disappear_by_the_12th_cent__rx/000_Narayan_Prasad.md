Dear scholars,  
   Namaste.  
    In his travelogue published in 1878 under the title "Sketches of Ceylon and India", Prof. Ivan Minayev, who visited Bihar in March 1875, says regarding his visit to Rajgir:

  
"In the temples, the abundance of the Buddhist heritage is striking; here even small chaityas made of granite are turned into lingam; a lot of even other things are drawn here from former Buddhist temples and chapels." (Vol.1, p.207)  
  
I was curious to know more about the causes that led to such a situation. How did Buddhism almost disappear by the 12th century?  
  
Today I came across E.T. Atkin's article "Notes on the history of Religion in the Himalaya of the N.W. Provinces", JASB, Vol.53, 1884, pp.39-103.  
  
He has discussed this point in detail. Important passages are attached here as scanned pics. (from p.39 & p.41)  
  
Regards  
Narayan Prasad
