Prof. Deshpande,

  

Crux of Prof. George Hart as you understand, seems to be in your following words:

  

"Hart is referring to, as I understand, is that there is a poetic transition from the early Sanskrit epic poetry to the later classical Sanskrit poetry, and in his judgment, the earlier poetry was relatively speaking more descriptive, while the later classical poetry became more suggestive."  

  

Let me quote from Prof C. Rajendran's essay,

  

"The Perspective of a Pervasive Literary Theory of Indian Aesthetics: The Theory of Dhvani"  

  

"...... ..... but an analysis of earlier poetry shows that it is precisely the Dhvani

element in it which is the source of their charm. In this connection, he refers to

ancient works like Ramayana and Mahabharata wherein discerning critics find

that the source of charm is the suggested sense comprising the essence (tattva)

of Dhvani. Anandavardhana’s argument reminds one of the saying that apples

did fall from trees to the ground even before Newton discovered gravitation. What

Newton did was to formulate a theory to account for an obvious fact. Similarly,

Anandavardhana also was making sense of literature, whether ancient or

contemporary, with the new formulation. Here Anandavardhana concedes that a

literary theory, if it is to be regarded as universal must be applicable to all

literature of all times"
