I'd rejoice to see a positive contribution, from the gentleman with a fairly short Tamil name, instead of one liners thrown with the delicacy of a schoolyard bully.  

  

As I had requested before contributions should include quotes from Hart's thesis, the Tamil poems and real arguments. The steadfast determination to post without reading anything substantial is amazing, to say the least.
