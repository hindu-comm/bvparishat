As I already mentioned, reading the article by Prof. George Hart establishes that

  

the point Dhvani in Sanskrit poetry is an influence of Tamil poetry via Maharashtri Sattasai

  

***is not the main thesis of the article,***

  

***it is just a passing observation in a sentence at some point of the article***

  

and the main thesis is
