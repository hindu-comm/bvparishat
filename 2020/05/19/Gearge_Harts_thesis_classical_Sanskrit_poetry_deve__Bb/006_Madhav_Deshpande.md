Dear Paturi Ji,

  

  I am fully aware of the position of Ānandavardhana in his inclusion of the epics within his theory of *dhvani*, and his theory of *śāntarasa,* but this is an exception in the general Kāvyaśāstra.**Within the history of the Indian tradition the Mahābhārata is treated as Itihāsa \[which is then placed next to the Purāṇas attributed to Vyāsa, and generally not treated the same way as Rāmāyaṇa, the Ādikāvya. Widely considered as a smr̥ti by the Dharmaśāstra, the Mahābhārata would fall in the category of *śruti-sammita vedādiśāstra*as described in Mammaṭa's Kāvyaprakāśa, rather than in his *kāntāsammita* Kāvya. In any case, I was specifically discussing Hart's view in my book, not defending it or promoting it. I have made that clear, I hope. Please feel free to disagree with Hart's views.
