Vedanta Desika's poetry models itself after prior greats like Yamuna, Kuresa and Parasara Bhatta. They themselves have modeled their Sanskrit poetry on the Alvar poetry - you can read any traditional commentary on these poems. These Sanskrit poets' emotional stance, the amount of poetical images and expressions literally translated from Alvar poetry, especially Nammalvar's Thiruvaymozhi, tell their own tale. I dont have to tell you this.  

  

Nammalvar's poetry owes itself to early Tamil poetical models - especially the love poems of the Aham genre and the guide poems of the Puram genre. The Nayikabhava pioneered in Tamil by Nammalvar stems from poetry of the woman pining for her lover. Nayikabhava could not have been inspired by either Meghadutam nor any ghazals.  

  

That Nammalvar was primarily inspired by the Aham poetry and of course, Krishna, is well-known.  

  

  

The central focus of the Vedas may not be expressing something poetically,

but the poetic charm or poetic effect cannot be denied on that account.

  

Nobody's denying anything. But if you say everything was already in the Vedas, then India has not made any progress in the last 2500 years or so, depending on whatever date 'agnimILe purohitam' is assigned to by desi or Dalda Indology.

  

Thanks,
