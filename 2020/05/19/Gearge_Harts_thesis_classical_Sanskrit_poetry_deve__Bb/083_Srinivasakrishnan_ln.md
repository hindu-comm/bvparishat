Thanks, Ganesh-ji. You've repeated here the same points reeled out ad nauseam by others in the thread - that sanatana dharma and sanskrit are the fount of all wisdom in the Aham literature of Tamil, for example. Well, the others would say it's the fons et origo of all intellectual and not so intellectual endeavor in the entirety of Indian history.  

  

Despite your limited application of the fons et origo theory, I've nothing to add to what I've already said on the subject. Paturi-ji will say I'm repeating myself. Besides I am getting fed up of banging myself against the wall of Sanskritic apathy.



I'm curious however why this note had to be written in Sanskrit.
Perhaps the same reason why allopanishad was written in the first place. Perhaps an appeal to emotion was in order. It doesn’t change what I've been saying all along.



Let me say at the outset that I'm not familiar with your pujya guruji's works. I'm ready to rectify this lacuna if you could give me some references. Hopefully they are easily available.



There are however some allusions in your post which I must respond to:



1. You have not quoted anything from Tolkappiyam other than provide a stray reference to 'uLLurai uvamam'. Why even this stray reference?

  

There's a variety of other devices in the Tolkappiyam PoruL chapter with which the grammarian erects his lakshana edifice for poetry. Not sure if you are comfortable reading early Tamil. If you think everything therein is derivable from Panini or Bhartrhari, we can have a discussion.  

  

Tamil poetry has to be evaluated by resorting to categories of Tamil poetics. You are however using paraphrases - modern and medieval - of much later works on poetics. This is methodologically unsound. This is also a bit like comparing Ramayana and the Bible and finding Rama short because he was not crucified.  



2. I wouldn't cite Sri Nagaswamy as your pramana on this subject. He merely recycles a Dutch Indologist's views. Here's the reference:



Tieken, Herman Joseph Hugo. 2001. Kāvya in South India: old Tamil Caṅkam poetry. Groningen: Egbert Forsten.



Tieken's work has been severely criticized on methodological, critical historical and linguistic grounds. Here are a few reviews of his work:



G.E. Ferro-Luzzi. "Tieken, Herman, *Kavya in South India* (Book review). *Asian Folklore Studies*. June 2001. pp. 3733-74

Anne E. Monius, Book review, The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 61, No. 4 (November 2002), pp. 1404-1406.

George Hart III. "Review of Tieken's *Kavya in South India.*" *Journal of the American Oriental Institute* *124*:1. pp. 180-184. 2004.





I myself feel Tieken's grounding in Tamil texts at the time of writing was not very strong. People who interacted with him on e-lists would attest to this.



3. Sri Nagaswamy has been a wonderful writer on the subject of Siva temples and ancient archaeology. It pains me to say this but of late he has taken an unintellectual, emotion-based and sectarian position on many things. The Tamil ideologues, dubbed ‘Lemurians’ by somebody in this group, hold that everything in Tamil literature and Tamil culture from the earliest times was autochthonous. Sri Nagaswamy merely takes an unmitigated and diametrically opposite position that everything in Tamil literature and Tamil culture was from sanatana dharma and the Sanskrit. This might endear him to certain groups who dont want to evaluate the evidence.  

  

There’s however not much to choose between the Lemurians and Sri Nagaswamy in terms of lack of moderation.



4. Tamil is not a Prakrit and your chandra-chandrika example does not work. Prakrit gathas do not have the extensive system of interior landscapes for love poetry nor do they have the poetics worked out.



5. Habeas corpus is generally a good principle when there’s neglect of evidence. If you think everything is already available in Sanskrit or it’s been covered by Natyasastra, lets do a like to like comparison.



6. It’s also wrong to dub the Tamil Aham literature as muktaka verses. There are short poems and long poems. Many long poems (at least 400 of them) are 15-30 lines long. A few are even many hundreds of lines long. Ramanujan’s Interior Landscape could be a good beginning for you, in case you don’t wish to read the Tamil poetics books in Tamil medium.



Hope this helps,

  



Srini
