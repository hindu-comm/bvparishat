Dear Paturi Ji,

  

  You are quoting from my 1979 book, from which I provided one chapter in pdf form. In the quote you have provided, there is also my note of caution: "Hart's theory, as it stands, needs much more historical documentation to fill in the gaps." That said, among the Western scholars, Hart is among those rare scholars who is familiar with Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tamil poetry, and so his view needs consideration. As for me, I have no first hand knowledge of any Dravidian language, and depend on translations of Tamil poetry by scholars like Hart and A.K. Ramanujan. I am not advocating an independent opinion of myself about the connection of Sanskrit and Tamil poetry. It is not that languages don't have the layers of abhidhā, lakṣanā, vyañjanā etc., what Hart is referring to, as I understand, is that there is a poetic transition from the early Sanskrit epic poetry to the later classical Sanskrit poetry, and in his judgment, the earlier poetry was relatively speaking more descriptive, while the later classical poetry became more suggestive. His explanation of this transition as a result of the co-mingling of the Sanskrit, Prakrit and Tamil traditions is worth a consideration. Not having any first hand knowledge of Tamil, I am not the person to further evaluate Hart's proposals. With best regards,
