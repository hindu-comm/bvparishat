After reading, rereading after a long gap so to say, the article by Prof. George Hart, what I see is his focus on the comparison between early Tamil and Sanskrit taking the route of diffusion /influence that too a linear route of Tamil to Sanskrit (via Maharashtri Prakrit). A more comprehensive and non-linear , even if diffusionist/influence-oriented, comparative study would have been done, issues like love poetry, messenger poetry etc., multiple sources of Sanskrit love poetry and messenger poetry would have been recognized by him.
