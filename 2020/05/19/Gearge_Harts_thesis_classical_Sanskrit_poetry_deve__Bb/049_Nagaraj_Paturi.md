Griffith's translation

  

1. Ho there, my consort! Stay, thou fierce-souled lady, and let us reason for a while together.  
Such thoughts as these of ours, while yet unspoken in days gone by have never brought us comfort.  
2 What am I now to do with this thy saying? I have gone from thee like the first of Mornings.  
Purūravas, return thou to thy dwelling: I, like the wind, am difficult to capture.  
3 Like a shaft sent for glory from the quiver, or swift-steed winning cattle winning hundreds.  
The lightning seemed to flash, as cowards planned it. The minstrels bleated like a lamb in trouble.  
4 Giving her husband's father life and riches, from the near dwelling, when her lover craved her,  
She sought the home wherein she found her pleasure, accepting day and night her lord's embraces.  
5 Thrice in the day didst thou embrace thy consort, though coldly she received thy fond caresses.  
To thy desires, Purūravas, I yielded: so wast thou king, O hero, of my body.  
6 The maids Sujirni, Sreni, Sumne-api, Charanyu, Granthini, and Hradecaksus,—  
These like red kine have hastened forth, the bright ones, and like milch-cows have lowed in emulation.  
7 While he was born the Dames sate down together, the Rivers with free kindness gave him nurture;  
And then, Purūravas, the Gods increased thee for mighty battle, to destroy the Dasyus.  
8 When I, a mortal, wooed to mine embraces these heavenly nymphs who laid aside their raiment,  
Like a scared snake they fled from me in terror, like chariot horses when the car has touched them.  
9 When, loving these Immortal Ones, the mortal hath converse with the nymphs as they allow him.  
Like swans they show the beauty of their bodies, like horses in their play they bite and nibble.  
10 She who flashed brilliant as the falling lightning brought me delicious presents from the waters.  
Now from the flood be born a strong young hero May Uruvasi prolong her life for ever  
11 Thy birth hath made me drink from earthly milch-kine: this power, Purūravas, hast thou vouchsafed me.  
I knew, and, warned thee, on that day. Thou wouldst not hear me. What sayest thou, when naught avails thee?  
12 When will the son be born and seek his father? Mourner-like, will he weep when first he knows him?  
Who shall divide the accordant wife and husband, while fire is shining with thy consort's parents?  
13 I will console him when his tears are falling: he shall not weep and cry for care that blesses.  
That which is thine, between us, will I send thee. Go home again, thou fool;ṭhou hast not won me.  
14 Thy lover shall flee forth this day for ever, to seek, without return, the farthest distance.  
Then let his bed be in Destruction's bosom, and there let fierce rapacious wolves devour him.  
15 Nay, do not die, Purūravas, nor vanish: let not the evil-omened wolves devour thee.  
With women there can be no lasting friendship: hearts of hyenas are the hearts of women.  
16 When amid men in altered shape I sojourned, and through four autumns spent the nights among them,  
I tasted once a day a drop of butter; and even now with that am I am contented.  
17 I, her best love, call Urvasi to meet me, her who fills air and measures out the region.  
Let the gift brought by piety approach thee. Turn thou to me again: my heart is troubled.  
18 Thus speak these Gods to thee, O son of Iḷā: As death hath verily got thee for his subject,  

Thy sons shall serve the Gods with their oblation, and thou, moreover, shalt rejoice in Svarga.
