(In addition to and continuation of what Prof. Paturi has said :)

Alongside, if it is conceded that Veda is poetry,

there can be no denying the fact that it has *dhvanyartha* in it.

  

Western scholars have lebelled it poetry just to - as is their wont - just to denigrate its value  

viz. the value accorded by tradition, even which, by their own confession and assertion

is continuous and unbroken.

  

The very presumption that the Veda is more accessible to them

than to the very people who have treasured it as a revered possession

smacks not a little of impudence.  

  

That the Veda is replete with metrical constructions by no means inferior  

(at the level of physical structure) , and abounds in metaphors and personifications

which are no small measures of poetic genius (at the level of its deep content)

\- can surely not be disputed.  

  

That a language and its literature of such a hoary antiquity still yield deep ideas

is itself not a small miracle.

  

The idea of Suggestion is not something that can be or needs to be imitated  

by looking into another mass of literature and subsequently incorporated.

  

That the word *kavi* already occurs in the Vedic, and that the *kavi* and the *RShi*  

are placed on par - should themselves speak volumes for the Vedas  

as poetry of no mean order.

  

The very opening *Rc* of the first *sUkta* of the Rgveda involves mystical ideas

bodying forth as a poetic exclamation.

  

No *upamA* or *rUpaka* is, for that matter, without its quota of *dhvanyartha*,

it cannot be gainsaid.  

  

Additional tools of investigation may facilitate handling the language,

but *etic* interpretations cannot easily lay claim to arrive at the very heart and soul of the issue.
