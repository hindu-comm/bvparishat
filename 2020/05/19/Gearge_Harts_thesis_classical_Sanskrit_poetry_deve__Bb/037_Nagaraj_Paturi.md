Dear Sri L Srinivas,

  

I don't understand what specific points you are trying to counter with which specific logic or argument of you.

  

First let us start with this.

  

I am a great lover of Tamil language, its literature, its poetry, its original contributions to world's knowledge systems, skills, aesthetic creations in general and Indic knowledge systems, skills, aesthetic creations in particular.

  

Since you want to obfuscate through the strawman arguments by putting claims not made by your correspondents into their mouth by making statements such as such as "Well, apparently everything is not there in the Vedas. Building jet propulsion aircraft is certainly one of them" your correspondents can make statements such as you claim that all the world languages, literatures and cultures emerged from one single Tamil land piece on which Tamil was spoken. But I don't want to resort to such bad conversational etiquette.

  

Who claimed that everything is in Vedas. If Vedas are looked at as poetry it is not the same as saying there is everything in the Vedas.

  

If concepts like Dhvani are being identified as universally applicable analytical tools of poetic aesthetics, there is nothing Macaulayanabout it, it is in fact anti-Macaulayan.

  

For example, if Akam , Puram categorization in Tolkappiyam is identified as a new contribution to academics from a Tamil grammarian which is universally applicable, it is not the same as saying that creation started a piece of land of Tamil speakers. It is not Macaulayan.

  

You need to show that there is no Dhvani in Mahabharata to counter the my position here.

  

I alreadysaid that I am waiting to see a **theory of Dhvani** in pre-Anandavardhana Tamil poetics. In fact, I will be proud to know that. But that is not the focus.

  

Focus is whether there is Dhvani in Mahabharata or not.

  

There is no need to quote any Tamil poem or anypartof Tolkappiyam here because there is no statement made against any of them. There is no need to establish any negative claim made about Tamil because no such claim is made.
