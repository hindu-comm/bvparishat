Prof. Kannan,

  

I earnestly request you not to join some conversations when it is not required.

  

We used to request our father not to join us when some quarrel with a neighbour or something like that erupts 9he very rarely used to venture, but whenever he used to, with some genuine anguish)

  

This was to avoid he ourdeeply respected father not getting bad mouthed by the other party.

  

Please understand.

  

You need not explain that the last part of your name is a tadbhava of Sanskrit origin , not a native Tamil word.
