\> Also, let's leave poetical theories aside. It's the poetry that matters although Tamil has poetics as part of the language grammar from

very early times - at least a few centuries before Anandavardhana.

  

--- That is exactly the distinction being made, emphasized and is being sought to be considered.

  

There are no claims here about Anandavardhana is the first poetician /aalankarika or Sanskrit is the first language to start poetics. The discussion was specific to a very specific concept / theorization in poetics called Dhvani. If there is evidence that there are older theorizations about the same in some other languages like Tamil, that will be interesting to know.

  

But even that comes as a matter of focus, not the main focus of discussion here.

  

The argument being made was that the claim that poetry in a certain language had dhvani in it and poetry in another language did not have dhvani in it , this other language developeddhvani-poetry at a later time is not justifiable because the dhvani being aatmaa of poetry applies to all poetry in all languages ; for example, even Homer and Virgil have Dhvani in their epics in Greek and Latin. (guNeebhoota vyangyakaavyas, where dhvani is dominated by other deflecting aspects nevertheless have vyangya in them. Chitrakaavya, a non-dhvani kaavya is an identified category , but that is only an adhamakaavya and a later development; epics like Mahabharata can not be characterised as such non-Dhvani, Chitra kaavyas) Even if, for the sake of an argument, it is agreed that old poetry in a certain language had dhvani and the poetry of the same period in a certain other language of the same period did not have dhvani, it developed dhvani-ful poetry at a later period, to prove that dhvani-fulness travelled from the former to the latter language needs a lot of evidence to establish that point. But that argument of poetry in a language of a certain time is dhvaniful and the poetry in some other language of the same period does not have dhvani itself is flawed.

  

One could argue that texts like Mahabharata were not poetry at all and as such all poetry has dhvani does not apply to such works.

  

But people who studied Mahabharata can not help agreeing with the claim inside that text itself it is poetry for those who study/ analyse poetry just as it is dharma shaastras for dharmajnas, puraaNa for pauraaNikasetc. many things from many different perspectives, can not help agreeing with Anandavardhana who applies his own concept to the text of Mahabharata.

  

It is easy to provide examples all the thousands of the dhvani varieties from dhvanyaalokafrom text of Mahabharata, for that matter from Odyssey , Aenid etc.

  

As Prof. Kannan rightly pointed out we can show many different varieties of dhvani in the Veda mantras too.

  

Purpose of a text does not come in the way of that text having dhvani. Subtle communication that dhvani is, may be found in a contemporary advertisement too. The purpose of that text being selling a product not dhvani does not come in the way of it having dhvani. In fact, its purpose itself requires it to have dhvani.
