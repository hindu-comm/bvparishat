Since some intrepid readers of this group have found the PDFs, the job's been made easier. You can add the old Tamil grammar, Tolkappiam, to your list. It has three chapters. The first two are on ezuttu (varNa) and sol (pada) while the third is poruL (poetics).

God, I didnt expect to read this on this list. If I didnt know it was from you, I'd have thought it's from a cross of Macaulay and Witzel.

Maybe that's why the Rgveda qualifies as Indo European poetry.

Gurajada Appa Rao pointed it out before him in 'kanyasulkam' - anni vedaallone undassha.  

  

Well, apparently everything is not there in the Vedas. Building jet propulsion aircraft is certainly one of them. What's been acknowledged to be the hallmark of good poetry (call it by whatever name) in later Indian critical tradition is clearly another. I dont insist on it.  

  

But we should perhaps wait for an informed discussion after Hart and more importantly, some representative Tamil poems, have been given a reading.  

  

Thanks,
