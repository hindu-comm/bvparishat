Friends,

  

That dhvani is an attribute of human speech can be easily established.

it is a function of various brain waves that operate in the neural network.

How they combine in different modes of expression (rasa) needs study.

This internal dhvani eventually transforms into tunes and melody in

human expression. There are various limitations on its production

which include the neural processing time scale and our breathing cycle.

What we credit Anandavardhan is to create an analytic study of the

process empirically. The theory should transcend the language barrier.

Hearing and reception models are being published, no speech model yet.

  

People who are interested may do small experiments in their own speech

or in conversations.

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
