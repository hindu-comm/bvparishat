Tamil poetical theories are available in English - to a limited extent. KV Zvelebil, G L Hart, K Kailasapathy, AK Ramanujan, Takanobu Takahashi (sp?) etc have written on the subject. There are some recent Tamil writers who have been translated into other languages. Ramanujan's after essays in translations may give a good insight. He was a Kannada and English poet himself and a gifted translator and a very persuasive writer.  

  

Hart's burden is that dhvani was nearly all important from the earliest times in Tamil poetry. That's not the case, according to him, in the case of early Sanskrit poetry. There's not much to disagree with there. The earliest Sanskrit poetry that has come down to us intact may have had a different purpose. Also, let's leave poetical theories aside. It's the poetry that matters although Tamil has poetics as part of the language grammar from very early times - at least a few centuries before Anandavardhana.   

  

Of course, the early Tamil poetry needs to be read for a determination to be made. The difference between early Tamil and the Sanskrit poetry is in the aesthetic, not in ideology. This along with a long engagement with the scholastics of alankara is what makes the Tamil poetry different and trend setting in India. You feel the dhvani, you dont do siddhi of it :)  

  

This difference may be small but it could be significant. The late Kesarbai Kerkar and other old style women singers never sang ghazals on the grounds that in Indian poetry it was the woman who pined for the man. They could not internalize a man's emotion and miss the beloved so as to sing the ghazal with bhava. Perhaps sometimes it takes an artiste to feel the pain of another.

  

Hope this helps,
