For Prof George Hart , Sanskrit is Sanskrit. Only when it comes to Maharashtri Prakrit , it suddenly turns out to be IA, in the article being discussed.

  

We are not doing any Desi Indology here.

  

But the Swadeshi Indology movement, of which I was not a part, I did not attend a single conference, but when they do, I think they don't shy away from the IE, PIE, IA, PIA etc.
