Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

It is only the words of somebody in this very thread that I quoted.

Just to hold a mirror to what the gentleman with a fairly long Sanskrit name himself said

(at 4.48pm, as per my computer, yesterday).

Nothing else. Nothing indeed that would concern you.

  

Regards

KSKannan
