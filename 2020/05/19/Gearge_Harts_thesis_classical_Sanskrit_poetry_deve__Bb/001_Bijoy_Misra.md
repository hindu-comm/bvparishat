Do we also have a copy of George Hart's thesis?

  

I think the synthetic communication through sound and melody could be much older than the organized language.

It could be also true that certain folk tunes did develop through natural melody in course of time.

The structural analysis would be much later after the syllables were identified.

  

I cannot give a whole lot of examples at the present time, we are studying.
