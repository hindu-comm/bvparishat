\> You need not explain that the last part of your name is a tadbhava of Sanskrit origin , not a native Tamil word.  

  

Not to put too fine a point on it. The Madras Tamil Lexicon has two entries for the word/name. One is a Tamil word and the other is derived from Prakrit. It doesnt mention Sanskrit at all.  

  

Hope this helps,
