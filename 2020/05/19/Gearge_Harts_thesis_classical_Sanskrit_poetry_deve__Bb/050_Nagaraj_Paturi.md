Messenger poem in Rig Veda:

  

RV_5,061.17a etam me stomam ūrmye dārbhyāya parā vaha \|  
RV_5,061.17c giro devi rathīr iva \|\|  
RV_5,061.18a uta me vocatād iti sutasome rathavītau \|  
RV_5,061.18c na kāmo apa veti me \|\|  
RV_5,061.19a eṣa kṣeti rathavītir maghavā gomatīr anu \|  
RV_5,061.19c parvateṣv apaśritaḥ \|\|  

  

Griffith's translation :

17 O Urmya, bear thou far away to Darbhya this my hymn of praise,  
Songs, Goddess, as if chariot-borne.  
18 From me to Rathaviti say, when he hath pressed the Soma juice,  
The wish I had departeth not.  
19 This wealthy Rathaviti dwells among the people rich in kine,  
Among the mountains, far withdrawn.
