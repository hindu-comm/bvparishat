While considering the *vyan'gyArtha* present in instances of  

humour, proverbs, and *laukika*-*nyAya*-s,

Dr HRMeera has drawn attention to the presence of the same  

in advertisements and propaganda too

in her PhD thesis on the ubiquity of the Non-literal Sense.

  

It is only a stultified mind that can even conceive of *vyan'gyArtha ,* so universal  

as starting from such-and-such a date or initiating in such-and-such a literature.
