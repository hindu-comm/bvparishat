Thanks, respected shataavadhaani Ganesh-ji.

  

When it comes from a colossal scholar acquainted with poetry in so many languages including Tamil , Prakrits and Sanskrit that are being discussed here, it means a lot.

  

Probably wrong words and concepts have been used to communicate some significant observations. Nevertheless that wrong use of words needs to be pointed out.

  

My guess is that something like Rasa-centric or poetic relish-centric poetry in Tamil is older in Tamil than a similar poetry in Sanskrit -- or something like that seems to be what is intended to be communicated here.

  

Aarsha poetry though has intense aesthetic aspects in it , those aspects may get overshadowed by instructional aspects such as Dharma and Moksha.

  

In laukika kaavyas though there is no absence of instructional aspects such as Dharma and Moksha, they may get overshadowed by Rasa-centric and other poetic beauty-centric nature of that poetry.

  

Tamil poetic beauty-centric poetry is older than the laukika Sanskrit poetry -- seems to be the point attempted to be made here.

  

Pranaams,

  

Nagaraj
