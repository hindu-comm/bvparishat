\> Paturi-ji will say I'm repeating myself. Besides I am getting fed up of banging myself against the wall of Sanskritic apathy.

  

The problem is not that you are repeating. It is that you are repeating the lies. You are repeating your false assumptions about and /or false attributions to your correspondents.

  

For example, the following lie :

  

You've repeated here the same points reeled out ad nauseam by others in the thread - that sanatana dharma and sanskrit are the fount of all wisdom in the Aham literature of Tamil, for example. Well, the others would say it's the fons et origo of all intellectual and not so intellectual endeavor in the entirety of Indian history.  

  

Can you show one sentence, phrase or word by me or any other contributor to the thread , Where " that sanatana dharma and sanskrit are the fount of all wisdom in the Aham literature of Tamil " ?

  

You say, "I'm curious however why this note had to be written in Sanskrit." while it is possible in this forum dedicated primarily to Sanskrit and secondarily to anything else, you are getting surprised at a communication in Sanskrit, while logically it should be the other way round. And then you proceed to a totally irrelevant example of Allopanishad. The critics of texts like Allopanishad would see attempts either on the Islam side to make Islamic ideas look like Vedic ideas or
or on the Vedic side to incorporate Islamic ideas into the Vedic fold. What is the equivalent of the Islamic ideas in this note in Sanskrit ?

  

It was just a communication in the language in which the speaker is most comfortable, the language which is the primary focus of the forum and as such expected to be not resisted by the forum when used for communication.

  

You say, "Perhaps an appeal to emotion was in order. It doesn’t change what I've been saying all along."

  

Who would anyone expect that from a repeating machine that really does not discuss the point on hand, Dhvani in Sanskrit poetry coming from Dhvani in Tamil poetry ? How would anyone expect that from a source which misunderstands " X need not come into A from B" as " X came into B from A " ( X =dhvani; A =Sanskrit; B =Tamil )

  

"Tamil is not a Prakrit and your chandra-chandrika example does not work." again is a similar strawman technique. Dr Ganesh called Tamil a Prakrit. His reference only to the proposition of a feature moving from the Prakrit of Sattasai into Sanskrit. There was no focus on Tamil in the sentence involving Chandra Chandrikaanyaaya.

  

"everything is already available in Sanskrit or it’s been covered by Natyasastra", is not a claim made here. So no need of any like to like comparison.

  

You say,

  

"It’s also wrong to dub the Tamil Aham literature as muktaka verses. There are short poems and long poems. Many long poems (at least 400 of them) are 15-30 lines long. A few are even many hundreds of lines long."

  

You seem to have misunderstood the word muktaka as meaning 'short' or some word referring to the length of a poem. All your next sentences talk about length.

  

Muktakas are texts, verses in which are not bound in sequence to each other. The poems in the text are independent of each other. The word is contrasted with Prabandha. Prabandha is a poetic text in which the verses / poems are tightly bound sequentially to each other. For example a narrative poem. You can not jumble the order of verses in that lest the narrating order should get damaged.

  

Waiting for the Tamil quotes establishing the existence of Dhvani theory in Tamil poetics before Anandavardhana.

  

Did you claim that there is Dhvani theory in Tamil poetics before Anandavardhana ? No, you didn't.

  

But you said, There are great concepts of Poetics in Tamil Poetics centuries before Anandavardhana. Did we say anything opposite to this claim of you to prompt you to make this statement ? We didn't.
