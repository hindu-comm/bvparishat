Thank you, Prof Kannan and Dr Steiner.

  

Here's a short book Hart published in 1976, and here he seems to be saying that there was a single source for both streams of poetry, rather than one borrowed from the other.

I found the PDF for the 1975 books, but it's too big, so I'll send Google Drive links to the thread participants directly.
