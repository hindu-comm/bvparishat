Only because I felt free to disagree with my good friend Prof. George Hart's views, I did express my views here.

  

Your 1979 article includes this as one of the arguments for the point it makes.

  

Your article argues that Natya Shastra's inclusion of Prakrits reflects a change of position of/ attitude towards Prakrits.

  

I already expressed my disagreement with this position and said that it was just part of linguistic realism , lokavrittaanukaranam that NS takes and had nothing to do with a change of status of Prakrits.
