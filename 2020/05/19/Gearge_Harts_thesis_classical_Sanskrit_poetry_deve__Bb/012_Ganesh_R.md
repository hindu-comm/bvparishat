Dear Prof. Paturi sir,

  

I agree with your point that focusses on the fact that lakshya can exist independent of lakshana.

  

Having carried out my studies for several decades in poetics and poetry that encompass Kannada, Telugu,Tamil, Prakrit, Sanskrit and several other languages by reading the original texts, I know how unfair is to discredit Anandavardhana.

  

It is too well known to most of us that why such obnoxious attempts are made by some people in the name of research.

  

With warm regards

  

Ganesh
