Dear Prof. Deshpande,

  

I found in your article " Natya Shastra and Sanskrit Poetics" , that you shared in the thread on "Prakrits in Sanskrit plays", the following :

Isn't it counter-intuitive to say that features like Dhvani are found only in / from the time of poetry in a certain language and then entered/ is borrowed from that poetry into the poetry of another language, while the fact is that the vaachya, lakshya and vyangya levels of meaning can exist in any language of the world, both in the day to day and poetic versions of those languages and what is new is not its occurrence but recognising its occurrence in day to day language, poetic language and narrative poetic language and what is new is theorising that it is the aatmaa of kaavya, and that novelty started in Sanskrit poetics culminating in Dhvanyaaloka of Anandavardhanaachaarya ?
