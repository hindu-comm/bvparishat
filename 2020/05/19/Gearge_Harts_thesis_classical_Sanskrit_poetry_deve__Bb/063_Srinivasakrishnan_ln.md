For sthali pulaka nyaya shastris, I'd add that who can be a duta and what the dutas do has been elaborately worked out in the lakshana granthas of Tamil poetics. This is quite apart from the fact in the earliest Tamil poetry, there is extensive use of the messenger poem genre.  

  

Tolkappiyam construct of 'vAyil' and the grammar thereof may be consulted for this.
