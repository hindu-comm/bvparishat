The point is fairly straightforward. Anyone who wants to enjoy good Sanskrit poetry does not curl up with the Ramayana or the Mahabharata. The epics might have great merits but being great lyrical or rasa laden poetry is clearly not one of them. Where does this new aesthetic come from? So Hart offers a theory here. If you wish to quote Anandavardhana here, the question arises why no one before Anandavardhana? Someone even offered the theory that 'just because there's no lakshana, doesnt mean there's no lakshya'. So where's the lakshya? So if you read Hart, he will tell you where this kind of lakshya begins.  

  

You cant be all anhistorical and say that everything always existed before. Literary productions depend on prior literary productions but there's also fresh beginning made by charismatic pathbreakers. If that's not the case, why every early modern Indian language poet thinks so highly of Tagore? Why every short story writer in modern Indian languages owes so much to Sarat Chandra? More to the point, why was there no short story genre in Indian languages before a particular point in our literary history? Why are there no personal poems of love and its pain of ordinary people in the earliest Sanskrit poetry, especially of the sort which is there in the early Tamil poetry?  

  

I deem further discussion futile unless you quote some specific points made by Hart (alluded to by Prof Deshpande in his old work), cite some of the poems he refers to and refute it using Sanskrit poems from the earliest strata like epics or the Vedas.  

  

Hope this helps,
