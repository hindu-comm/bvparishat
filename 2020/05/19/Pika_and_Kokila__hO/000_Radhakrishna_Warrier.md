I have seen the Sanskrit tatsama words pika and kokila used for the same bird known as koyal in Hindi and kuyil in Malayalam / Tamil, which in English is cuckoo I believe.

  

Is there actually a difference between pika and kokila? I have come across many ladies with the name Kokila but yet to come across a single lady bearing the name Pika. If both words denote the same bird, why no one is given the name Pika?
