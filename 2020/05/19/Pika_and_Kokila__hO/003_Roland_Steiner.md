\> Pika is a mleccha word.  
  

\> The instance of Tamarasa (तामरस) as an Anarya word  
  

According to Śabara, yes. According to Mayrhofer, *pika* is "apparently onomatopoeic", *tāmarasa* "apparently Dravidian". Just for your information.

  
  
  
\> with तामरस having a blue-ish hue  
  

According to Wilhelm Rau ("Lotusblumen," in: *Asiatica*. Festschrift für Friedrich Weller. Leipzig 1954, pp. 505-513), who investigated the use of words for "lotus" in *kāvya* texts, *tāmarasa* refers to the flower of white-reddish, but also pure white and more strongly reddish blooming lotuses.  
  
A "blue lotus" does not occur in nature. Botanically speaking, it is a blue water-lily. See Jürgen Hanneder: "The Blue Lotus. Oriental Research between Philology, Botany and Poetics?" In: *Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft* 152.2 (2002), pp. 295–308.
