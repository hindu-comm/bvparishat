The Sanskrit crow also caws.

Hence it is called *kArava*.

  

*vayaM **kAkA** vayaM **kAkA**  
*

*iti jalpanti vAyasAH.*

*  
*

To the question  

"Who, who indeed will give us freedom from fear?,

*- kA kA abhaya-pradA ?*  

the answer is supplied by the compounded form

*- kAkAbhayapradA*  

(= She who gave freedom from fear to Mr. KAka(*asura*))

= Goddess LakShmI.  

  

This is famous:

*kAka iti s'abdAnukRtiH.*

*  
*

And we have names built on names:

The crow is called *dvika*,

as there are two *ka*-s in its famed name,

(-yes, comparable to the bee being called *dvirepha*

owing to the two r-s in the famous word for it viz. *bhramara*).
