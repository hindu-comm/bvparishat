The instance of Tamarasa (तामरस) as an Anarya word reminded me of a Tulsidas verse, wherein he has used both Arya and Anarya words for lotus:

  

नील तामरस स्यामकाम अरि

ह्रदय कंजमकरंद मधुप हरि।

  

Is it possible that तामरस and कंज are two different varieties of lotus, with तामरस having a blue-ish hue andकंज having a reddish color?
