Thanks for your patient reply Dr. Pathuri. I used to follow these discussions ten years ago whenSamuel' book (2008) and Mark Singleton's book came out (Yoga Body: The Origins of Modern Posture Practice, 2010). Honestly, I haven't been following the recent scholarly discussions and wondered if there were additional books with a entirely different narrative. Has there been any books summarizing the perspectives emerged after the 2013 Vienna conference? I appreciate it, if you could suggest any recent books or papers to understand thecurrent perspective. (I see a newer book by By James Mallinson, Mark Singleton titled "Roots of Yoga" (2017), although, I haven't read it).

  

Thanks,

Suresh.
