I am not aware of any later edition of this work, Sri Kolichala-ji.

  

If your reference is to the present tense in my "More nuanced analysis is emerging", let me say that for me 2008 is enough of present tense as I thought that the tracing of Yoga to Buddhism etc. is older and this book does not do it and traces the roots in a more intricate way.

  

But Dr Koenraad Elst was alerting me that the whole narrative change towardsBuddhist origin started in 2013.

  

He said,

  

"The narrative is indeed changing, but not in the good sense. This book by Samuel is very good, but more than ten years old. From the historic Vienna conference on the history of yoga in 2013 onwards, the Buddhist origin of yoga has gained a lot of ground."

  

I don't know if you had this in mind when you asked about later editions of the book.
