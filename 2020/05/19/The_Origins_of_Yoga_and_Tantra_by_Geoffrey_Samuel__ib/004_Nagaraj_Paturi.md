Dear Sri Kolichala-ji,

  

I can share many individual articles, but did not see a collection of them at one place.

  

As you know , among the two positions, 1. Yoga, Ayurveda etc. all have roots only outside the Vedic tradition and 2. There are roots of Yoga, Ayurveda etc. in Vedic tradition, I get attracted to the books with position #2. I love to read the books with position #1 too because that is my purva paksha.

  

I will share if I find a collection.
