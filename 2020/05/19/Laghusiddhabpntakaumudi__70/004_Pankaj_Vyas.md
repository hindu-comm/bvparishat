Namamsi,

One more sanskrit commentary named "Chandrakala" is available with hindi teeka. (Though it is an adhunika teeka) Both sanskrit and hindi teekas written by Prof. Arkanath Chaudhary. He is now director of Jaipur campus of Central sanskrit university (formerly Rashtriya sanskrit sansthan). It was published from Jagadish sanskrit pustakalay prakashan, Jaipur.

Thanks
