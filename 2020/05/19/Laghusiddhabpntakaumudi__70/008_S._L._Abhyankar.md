नमस्ते महोदय !

Download link for Ballantyne's English translation of लघुसिद्धान्तकौमुदी is available at \<<http://www.sanskritebooks.org/2009/04/laghu-siddhanta-kaumudi-english-translation-jr-ballantyne/>\>

I guess, being an English translation, Dr. Ballantyne has made it as much simple to understand for any English-knowing person.
