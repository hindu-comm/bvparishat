"This ground-breaking work on Indian philosophical doxography examines the function of dialectical texts within their intellectual and religious milieu. In[*Dialogue and Doxography in Indian Philosophy: Points of View in Buddhist, Jaina, and Advaita Vedānta Traditions*](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0367226138/?tag=newbooinhis-20)(Routledge, 2020),[Karl-Stéphan Bouthillette](https://research.flw.ugent.be/en/karlstephan.bouthillette)examines the Madhyamakahṛdayakārikā of the Buddhist Bhāviveka, the Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya of the Jain Haribhadra, and the Sarvasiddhāntasaṅgraha attributed to the Advaitin Śaṅkara, focusing on each of their representation of Mīmāṃsā, to arguing that each of these doxographies represent forms of spiritual exercise."
