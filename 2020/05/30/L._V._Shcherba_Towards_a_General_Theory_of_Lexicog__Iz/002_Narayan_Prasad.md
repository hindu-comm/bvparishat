Thank you so much Dr Irene.

  

I got also the link, just today only through a Russian, for the original 1940 edition.

The English translation (1995) is based on this edition only, instead of 1974 that was modified version not by the original author L.V. Scerba who died in 1944.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
