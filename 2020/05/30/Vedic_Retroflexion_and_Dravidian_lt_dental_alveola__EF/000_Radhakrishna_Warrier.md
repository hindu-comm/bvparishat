Prof. Deshpande ji’s *Vedic Retroflexion* is quite interesting.

  

There is a suggestion in it that evolution of a dental sound to alveolar (as a result of combinations such as rt, rd, rn) got interpreted as retroflexion by Aryan-Dravidian bilinguals and hence turned retroflex.

  

I think ancient Dravidian had alveolar ṯ, in addition to dental t and retroflex ṭ. Similarly it likely had retroflex, alveolar and dental n.
Malayalam has all these.

  

In Dravidian, there is a tendency for combinations such as l+ dental t to become alveolar ṯ.

  

In Malayalam, for certain types of verbs, past tense is formed by adding dental “tu” to the verb root.

  

Vilkkŭ means to sell. The root is "vil". Past tense ‘sold’, is formed by vil+tu and it becomes viṯṯu (alveolar ṯ).

  

Ēlkkŭ = to take responsibility, to get hit, etc. Past tense ēl+tu = ēṯṯu (alveolar ṯ).

  

Poṉ + tār (golden flower, or golden lotus) becomes polttār (dental t) and then poṯṯār (alveolar ṯ).  Poṯṯār mātāvŭ ("golden lotus mother") is Maha Lakshmi.

  

The past tense suffix tu can also become retroflex when preceded by retroflex ṇ, as: Kaṇ = eye and also root of “to see”. Past tense kaṇ + tu = kaṇṭu (pronounced kaṇḍu).
