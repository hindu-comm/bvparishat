Namaste



1. While one is on the topic of text-transaltion using using
lexicons- and grammar :: bhashaa anuvaada using Vyakarana (Panini) and Kosha (Amara simha and others), it may be interesting to see how lexicographers have looked at themselves in a ' mirror' ! (Atma bimba - sva-vimarsha!) 



2. Here is the link to explore how respected V.S.Apte makes note on lexicographers work and makes an onservation on ' Monier Williams Translation (?).



I have not thought it desirable, like Professor Monier Williams, to insert words the English explanation of which has to be systematically translated, in order to give some idea of their meaning. **‘Indian-rubber’ is translated by अतिस्थितिस्थापकविशिष्टो भारतदेशीयवृक्षनिर्यासः; ‘Shuttle cock’ by लघुगुलिकाविशेषः यो विनोदार्थं दंडाहतो भूत्वा इतस्ततः प्रक्षिप्यतेः** and many others of this nature, which can be translated by विशेषः ‘a kind of tree, flower, fruit’ &c. Such words may be retained by the student in their English form, or their meaning may be translated if he desire to have them in a Sanskrit garb. स्पंजः ‘Sponge,’ द्युकः ‘Duke,’ सावनं ‘Soap,’ लाटिनं ‘Latinity’ (as given by Mr. Borooah) may, I think, be very safely omitted even in
a comprehensive Dictionary

3. It may also be worth contemplating on the following observation of V.S.Apte in modeling the student Sanskrit dictionary, from same link above.



**' Some words are now necessary as to the plan and scope of the Dictionary. When I resolved to make this Dictionary as complete as possible, consistently with its aim of being useful for the student, I took the latest edition of Webster’s Complete Dictionary, and taking that as my basis, proceeded with the work of compilation. As I advanced, I found that several words, phrases and expressions and several senses of single words, could not be adeqately represented in Sanskrit, so as to appear like Sanskrit, either because the words &c. were purely technical and referred to specific ideas in subjects, such as Chemistry, Botany, Medicine, Psychology, Law, Engineering &c., or were such as had no corresponding ideas in Sanskrit and were peculiar to the English language. Words of this nature are numerous in Webster’s Dictionary, and I have omitted them, including also obsolete and rare words or senses of words.'**



 4. All this discussion throws open one single question with two faces : संस्कृत-पद-लक्षणं किम् ? संस्कृत-पदस्य - अर्थनिर्वचनसाधुत्वं कथं वक्तवम् ? ( भाषान्तरणं, भावानुवादः अन्यदेव)



**What is the necessary and sufficient condition for a a given word to be considered as a ' Word belonging to Langauge:Samskrutham ? **

**What is the appropriate way to settle the meaning of a word marked as ' belonging to the language class:Samskrutham'? **



I hope this adds to the scholars amusement in translating and re-translating a name across languages, making ' Radha-Krishna' to
become / convey (?) ' White and Black'.



This is not even the beginning of the avalanche of what has already rolled over out and stays out ' to be proof read in the form of
thousands of pages of digital entries' floating around in the web.



When serious researchers like Marcius and others seek help of scholars for proof reading sanskrit resoruces, it becomes more of a volunteer work with love for langauge.

And in many institutions of language-studies, the posts just earns a paycheck. (All exceptions and good work appreciated and respected. The 'black' sheeps do not take away the merit of rest of 'white' !)



For Scholars contemplation please.
