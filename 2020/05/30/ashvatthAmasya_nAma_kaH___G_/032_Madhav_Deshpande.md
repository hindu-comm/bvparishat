Dear Krishnaprasad,

  

  I found many occurrences of aśvattha in Vedic Saṃhitās listed in Vishvabandhu'sVaidika Padānukramakośa, including the instances that you have quoted. On your first occurrence in RV 1.135.8, I checked the Padapāṭha and found that it does not split the word like a normal compound formation, and in that sense the word is treated as a single undivided expression. Shri Jagannātha's citation from the Śabdakalpadruma is also interesting in that while deriving the expression aśvatthāman from aśva+sthāman, the change to aśvatthāman is treated according to the Pr̥ṣodarādi Gaṇa. Irregular formations are included in this Gaṇa for words that are still part of the usage of the Śiṣṭas.
