Dear Madhav,  
  
It is in fact an interesting difference. Mayrhofer assumes a non-Indo-Aryan (Dravidian?) suffix -*ttha*- in *aśvattha* (see the other plant names *kapittha*, *kulattha* and *dadhittha*). According to him, an etymological connection of *aśvattha* with the man's name *aśvatthāman* (-*sthāman* "location"?) is "not certain" ("steht nicht fest"; Mayrhofer, KEWA, s.v. *kulatthaḥ).* Mayrhofer is even more cautious in his EWA s.v. *aśvattha*. However, he sticks to his view that the man's name *aśvatthāman* contributes nothing to the interpretation of *aśvattha*.
