In an interview for the post of an Assistant Professor in the Bangalore University,

the external examiner who was very well dressed asked this first question to the first candidate :

ब्रह्मस्य किं लक्षणम् ?

To another, he put another golden question:  

कर्मस्य स्वरूपम् उपनिषदि किमस्ति?

Curse the fate, what else !
