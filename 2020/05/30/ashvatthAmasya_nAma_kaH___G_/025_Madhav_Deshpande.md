Dear Roland,

  

  Thanks for pointing out to पाकस्थामन् \[*Ṛgveda*8.3.21, and 8.3.24\]. What I find interesting is the difference between पाकस्थामन् and महास्थामन् on the one hand and अश्वत्थामन् on the other, is the change of -स्थामन् to -त्थामन् in the form अश्वत्थामन्, but not in the other formations. I wonder if अश्वत्थामन् is analogical to अश्वत्थ in some way.
