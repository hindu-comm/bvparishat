Dear Madhav,

  
  
\> Just remembered that one of the Buddhas mentioned in Mahayana Buddhist works is named Mahaasthaaman. There may be  
\> a few other names ending in sthaaman.  
  

pā́kasthāman ([n.pr](http://n.pr). of a man), *Ṛgveda* 8.3.21, and 8.3.24.  
  
By the way, in his "Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit Dictionary" Edgerton lists the form *mahāsthāma* as the name of a Bodhisattva "\[almost certainly short form for Mahāsthāmaprāpta, m.c.\]".  
  
Best wishes,  
Roland
