On the Vārttika *sthāmno 'kāraḥ*, Patañjali's Mahābhāṣya offers the example *aśvatthāmaḥ*. However, the Vārttika seems to be worded in more generic terms, and not restricted to a single derivation like this.
This raises some interesting questions. Are there any other known words like *aśvatthāman*that end in -*sthāman,* and the second question is whether any of the derived words like *aśvatthāmaḥ* are actually attested in literature other than being tailor-made examples in grammatical commentaries?
