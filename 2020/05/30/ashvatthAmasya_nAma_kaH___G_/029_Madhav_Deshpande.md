Dear Roland,

  

  Mayrhofer'sexplanation noted. What I have observed as far as the Indian traditions are concerned is that both words aśvatthāman and aśvattha are seen as being derived from a combination with the root sthā. By offering the example aśvatthāmaḥ on the Vārttika sthāmno 'kāraḥ, Patañjali clearly seems to see the word aśvatthāman as coming from aśva+sthāman, and on the Bhagavadgītā 15.1., Śaṅkarācārya's Bhāṣya glosses aśvattha with na śvo'pi sthātā. That would assume a derivation of aśvattha as a+śvaḥ+sthā. I didn't find a Yāskan etymology for either words, and we don't know what Pāṇini thought about them. I am wondering if the word aśvattha occurs in a Vedic Saṃhitā text and how the Padapāṭha treats this word. Need to do some more digging.
