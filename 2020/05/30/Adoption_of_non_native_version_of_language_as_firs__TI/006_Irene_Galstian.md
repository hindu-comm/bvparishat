Radhakrishna ji, it's interesting that you have several Armenian friends in Seattle. Normally it's Glendale or LA that have large Armenian populations, although there was at one point an Armenian church in Redmond, if I'm not wrong. By the way, I'm now sitting and imagining those "simple vegetariandishes", and it's nearly 11pm here...

  

Yes, you're spot on, that's the war. The timing of it wasn't good, since in December of 1988 Armenia was hit by a massive earthquake that wiped away a number of cities in a matter of minutes. My grandfather was at the hospital, supervising an operation (the earthquake happened around 11.30 or so in the morning); he felt the floor move under his feet, but that's in Yerevan, which got off lightly. A substantial percentage of Armenia was in complete ruins. International rescue teams reacted quickly and thanks to them and to the army, many survived who would've died otherwise, but even so, the orphanages were full to the brim, the hospitals couldn't handle the influx of so many trauma patients, many families of survivors lost each for years. Now a few months before that, Karabakh (or Artsakh, as it's called in Armenia), which was always a predominantly Armenian territory, formally attached to Azerbaijan, tried to get out of Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan retaliated by organising a series of genocides, especially in Sumgait and Baku. Lots of refugees came to Armenia, then the earthquake hit, and then on top of that the war started. In the beginning, Armenia lost a lot of innocent citizens because of irresponsible government and media behaviour: hearing patriotic speeches and knowing nothing about warfare, many 16-18 year old boys signed up from high schools to defend their motherland, but were quickly killed. The coffins were brought back to Armenia, and there was a huge public outcry, in the most literal sense. After that the Armenian government gradually took responsibility for their patriotic war campaigns and started a) training troops better before sending them out, b) calling experienced but retired military personnel from retirement and c) calling in people from ex-Soviet army reserves (in Soviet times all boys were required to serve in the Army for 2 years, with relatively few exceptions). Then things started going better, but in parallel with the war developments, Georgia and Azerbaijan tried to squash Armenia by cutting off gas and electricity supply, hence the hard times. But none of that could really alter the situation, and around 1994 Armenian army had the upper hand, and had taken control of Lachin, which is a strategic pass connecting Artsakh with Armenia. Since then until now, Artsakh is Armenian territory for all practical purposes, but theoretically it's still part of Azerbaijan, and all the peace talks so far stalled. The fact of the matter is, you can't really live in Artsakh safely if you're Azerbaijani, so lots of people were displaced, and there's a fair amount of bad blood between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, which added to the long-term bad blood between Armenians and Turks
because of the 1915 genocide(to Armenians, Azerbaijan and Turkey are the same thing). All of this is a pity, since I recall from childhood that people of many nationalities got along and lived side by side just fine in both Armenia and Azerbaijan.

  

Best wishes,

Irene
