Thanks for reminding me of Armenians. 

  

Nearly two decades ago, when I used to work in Vancouver, Canada, I had an Armenian colleague. He said he was born in Beirut, Lebanon and his family immigrated to Canada when he was seven years old. He said his Armenian was a little different from that spoken in Armenia. I don't remember if he said he his was the western or eastern dialect of Armenian. I asked him if his wife spoke good Armenian. He said "no, she is a white woman", meaning she was a Canadian of European origin. He said it as if he considered himself not white but he looked like any other white man although he had black hair and dark eyes like Indians.

  

I had another Armenian friend and colleague in recent years, here in Seattle. He said he came to the US as an adult. He was working in Armenia before he immigrated to the US. Besides Armenian, he speaks fluent Russian. He has authored technical papers in both Russian and Armenian. Russian was compulsory in school during his days in Armenia.
He said that when he came to the US, he knew very little English. He was not very fluent even in the script, as Armenian uses a different script and Russian of course is written in the Cyrillic (he calls it kirilik) script. I find that he now speaks and writes good English. He used to tell me many interesting stories of the communist days he grew up in Armenia. Once he used the word "Azadi" for independence, and I said hey, this is the same word we use in Hindi for independence. I believe many Persian words entered Armenian because of the close contact Armenians had with Persians. I was told that Armenia is called Hayastan in Armenian.

  

The Armenians I met had very typical Armenian names, not at all similar to Biblical Christian names. Names were like Sarkis, Hrant and so on. Most of them had surnames that ended in "ian".

  

I remember reading an article about the Armenians of Chennai. Actually it was an interview with a Chennai Armenian. His ancestors came to Chennai more than 200 years ago. He speaks Tamil like any other Tamilian and his food habits are also like those of an average Tamilian, the article said. In the picture, he looked like a fair Punjabi.

  

Regards,
