Dear Irene, Your emotional post on Armenia makes me nostalgic....

I visited your country in 1993 to participate in an international conference to commemorate the fifth year of the Great Spitak earthquake. On the day I landed in Yerevan via Moscow, with full of surprises, both pleasant and unpleasant, there was a severe earthquake in India called the Latur (Khilari) earthquake. After the initial hiccups (no electricity and warm water in the Yerevan Hotel) I enjoyed the country, beautiful and ancient, sharing perhaps forgotten Indic-Hindu links. I still recollect my visit to Garni to see a small (undamaged) temple atop a hill very much like here in India. The dark interior, the custom of lighting candles (oil lamps here), taking the main icon out of the shrine in a procession, the priest offering something like 'prasaad' to the visitors made me wonder where I was! The cultural evening with traditional dance and music organised for the delegates was memorable. The music in some parts sounded like Saama chants and I became homesick. Anyway after returning to Bangalore, I penned a brief travelogue<https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Downloads/download_pdf.php?titleid=id_067_03_0157_0161_0>

to relieve my emotions and get along with my routine here.

  

Thanks for taking me back by a few decades to recollect my view of Mt.Ararat, which our guide said is sacred to Armenians!

  

regards

Narayana
