Change of first language is an interesting process. Here are two cases that I have personally observed.

  

I know a few 3rd and 4th generation Konkani Christians in Mumbai. Their forefathers came to Mumbai from Goa. At some point in time, they dropped their original Konkani as first language. Interestingly, they did not adopt Marathi as their new first language. Nor did they adopt Mumbai Hindi. What they adopted was Indian English with a very thick Mumbai accent full of retroflex and geminate sounds. There are no geminate sounds in the English of native English speakers of UK, US, Australia or New Zealand. And of course, no retroflex t or d. But these Konkani Christians speak as their first language an English with geminate sounds and retroflex t's and d's. Most of them speak no Konkani or Marathi.  Mumbai English is their first language and Mumbai Hindi is their second language. Their Mumbai English would be a little tough for native English speakers to decipher.

  

There are some Anglo Indians in Kerala who speak English as their first language. This English is the highly Malayalam accented English that many Malayalis speak as a second language. This language too would be a real challenge for a native English speaker to understand.

  

Looks like the adoption of the new first language in the above two cases was not from native speakers of the new language, but from those who learned this language as a second language.
