The stories about your friends make complete sense to me on many levels. For example, I can see how it would be much easier for someone familiar with Armenian culture to adapt to Chennai than to the US, both culturally and in practical matters like food. When I first saw India, it felt like gigantic Armenia to me. I felt right at home within a few days, in spite of not understanding the languages around me. But it took me longer to adapt to the US ways of life, even when I did learn English, since neither Russian not Armenian backgrounds are 'Western' as such, and there's a rather steep learning curve to get used to the US.

  

As for Persian/Arabic words - yes, (Eastern) Armenian has plenty of them, and Western Armenian has even more, especially as spoken by people from Beirut, like your friend. What's left of historical Armenia speaks Eastern Armenian, and the huge Armenian diaspora speaks a mix of Western and Eastern, depending on personal/family circumstances. Greek Armenians have quite a few Greek words in their Armenian, and that's in addition to Greek tendencies in Armenian itself. By this I mean Greek tendencies that were part of Grabar (aka 'Classical Armenian', as foreign scholars call it).

  

It's true what you said about Armenians calling their country Hayastan, not Armenia. And 'an Armenian' (i.e. Armenian person) is called 'hay'. As for names, Biblical Christian names are still pretty popular, e.g. Petros (Peter), Poghos (Paul), Mathevos (Matthew), Ghukas (Luke), Hovannes (John), David (the 2nd d is pronounced more like Sanskrit th), Soghomon (Solomon), etc., not to mention endless traditional names on broadly biblical themes.

  

As for speaking both Russian and Armenian, there's an interesting story there. In Soviet times, for reasons of empire-building and empire-governing, school education outside of Russia was set up in the following way. High quality education was completely in Russian, with mother tongues being studied, of course, but not very vigorously, let's just put it that way. There was another stream of education in mother tongues, at least in the Soviet republics where these mother tongues has substantial literature and terminology in place. Armenian literature can certainly hold its own on the world stage, so Armenia had the Armenian education stream. There, subjects like mathematics, physics, geography were studied in Armenian, and literature and grammar of the Armenian language were given proper attention, whereas Russian and Russian literature were obligatory but not well-studied subjects. But when the Soviet Union fell (and shortly after that our family moved to Armenia), the nationalist movement rose up and turned all the schools into Armenian stream, leaving a few schools for people who were pure Russians or pure non-Armenians of some other kind (and one had to take A LOT of documents to the Ministry of Education to prove that). So the last few years of school I faced studying all the subjects in Armenian, and the only reason I survived was because my Armenian grandfather was a stickler for high Armenian and insisted on proper Armenian from all of us, for as long as I remember myself.

  

Those were unusual times. It seems surreal now to recall how we lived in Armenia during the war, with no gas or electricity, doing homework by the candle or trying to buy accumulators from Russian tanks stationed in Yerevan to connect a single light bulb for the entire household. Very strange times...
