Sir,

  

This may not necessarily be the case. Take, for example, Armenians who had to flee Armenia because of the 1915 genocide, to countries like Syria, Egypt, France, Greece, etc. The actual refugees spoke Armenian like the rest of Eastern Armenians, but afterwards, their descendants, who were born in the respective countries their parents ended up in, gradually spoke more and more differently, and a hybrid language was formed, what's known today as Western Armenian. Its pronunciation is unusual, it contains a predominance of participles in situations when Eastern Armenian speakers would use finite verbs, and it also contains words either archaic or simply not in Eastern Armenian dictionaries - BUT they speak fluent idiomatic Armenian nonetheless. This makes me think that there could be more to the scenarios you are describing in your post.

  

Thank you,

Irene
