Irene ji, just wanted to add that I bought my current house in the US through an Armenian realtor. He was introduced to me by the friend I spoke of in my previous post, the one who spoke Russian fluently. This realtor also spoke Russian as he was born and brought up in Armenia during the communist regime.

  

This realtor is quite at ease with things Indian. He used to call me by my full name Radhakrishna. Others here get frightened by my name and call me just Rad, the first three letters of the name üôÇ. He knew the meaning of the name too. He said he has visited India many times, including the city of Chennai. I think he visits the ashram of Sadguru Jaggi Vasudev. He enjoys Indian food. We invited him and his family to lunch one day. My wife prepared our usual simple vegetarian dishes.
She also prepared puri and shreekhand (sweetened yogurt<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrikhand> ) in Gujarati style and our humble Kerala style paalada paayasam (a kind of paayasam or kheer:<https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/palada-payasam-the-perfect-finish-to-a-meal-in-kerala-2027939>) . He, his wife and his daughter enjoyed all these very much. He said he goes to Hindu temples in the greater Seattle areas and enjoys the food supplied there. 

  

On another note, is the war you speak of the Armenia - Azerbaijan war of the late 1980's (or early 1990's)? What happened finally, did the contested area go to Azerbaijan or Armenia?

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
