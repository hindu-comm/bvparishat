Dear Irene,

  

  Thanks for sharing the account of your family's difficult years in Armenia. Your reference to doing homework in the candle light, reminded me of some months of my school year in Pune. My father and our landlord had some disagreement over how much rent he was charging, and as a result the landlord cut the electricity connection to our apartment.
This was right during the exam months, and I remember studying for my exams using kerosine lamps. The dispute was resolved in a few months and our electricity was on again. But I have heard of stories of Prof. Shridhar Ganesh Jinsiwale, my great-grand-mother's maternaluncle, who was a student at the Deccan College during 1870s. It was said that as a school boy he was studying for his exams sitting under a street light, when an Englishman saw him. The Englishman enquired about this boy and was told that he was a brilliant student, and he arranged for a scholarship for him at the Deccan College. Later Jinsiwale became a professor of Sanskrit at the Free Church College \[later Wilson College\] in Mumbai. My grandfatherused to tell me all these stories about the old days.
