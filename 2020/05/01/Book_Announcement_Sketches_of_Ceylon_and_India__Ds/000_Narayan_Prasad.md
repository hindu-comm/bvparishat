Dear Scholars,  

   Namaste.



      It's a pleasure to inform you that Ivan Minayev's work originally published in Russian in 1878, has been published as my English translation "Sketches of Ceylon and India: From the Travel Notes of a Russian" by Notion Press, Chennai.

  

Prof. Ivan Minayev (1840-1890)was a great Indologist. It is his travelogue which he wrote after visiting Ceylon, India and Nepal in 1874-75. In this book he has presented a vivid picture of the social, economic and political conditions of the then Ceylon, India and Nepal. He was mainly a Buddhist scholar and knew English, German, French, Pali, Sanskrit, Hindi and some of its dialects. He conversed in Pali with Buddhist monks.

  
      In this translation I have discussed also the latest research works (articles, books) up to January 2019 and hence it could be useful not only for general readers but also for Indologists.

  
      The research works are mainly those that were published by Prof. Alexey Vigasin, Moscow University. He kindly put at my disposal all these works and clarified many doubtful points for which I am very much grateful to him.
