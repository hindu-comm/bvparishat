\<\<Without the book it will remain impossible.>\>  

  

At present, Notion Press, Chennai, cannot deliver hard copy due to lockdown, which is supposed to be up to 17th May. I also have not received the complimentary copies. The publisher can supply only after the lockdown is lifted.

However, if anybody orders for a printed copy, he can immediately start reading it online and get its delivery after the lockdown is lifted.

I think, delivery of a printed copy in USA and UK is not a problem.
