\<\<I guess**BVP must create a databank**of scholars on the Listwho know (multiple, but especially)**foreign languages.**(- and even Pali and the various Prakrits etc.)\>\>

  

This is a very good idea.

  

There are a few native German and Russian speakers in this list. But I am not aware of any BVP members who are native Frenchspeaker(s).

Narayan Prasad
