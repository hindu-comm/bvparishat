On this occasion of the *publication of a translation of a book from Russian  
*

*by a private scholar well-versed in Panini and possessing multi-lingual interests and concerns  
*

*- all of which is no mean accomplishment,*  

I guess **BVP must create a databank** of scholars on the List  

who know (multiple, but especially) **foreign languages.**

(- and even Pali and the various Prakrits etc.)**  
**

**  
**

There may be occasions when some scholar in BVP  

requires the translation of some key passage/expression  

from German/French/Russian etc. to Sanskrit/English.

(Mere google-translations may not go a long way, after all).

  

This may help many.

Hope this is worth giving a trial.
