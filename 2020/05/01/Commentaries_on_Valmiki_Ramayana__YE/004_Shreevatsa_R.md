At[valmiki.iitk.ac.in](http://valmiki.iitk.ac.in) you can find a few commentaries on the Ramayana partially available, some available in Sanskrit and some (partially?) translated into English:

  

\- [Kataka](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/ecommentaries?field_commnetary_tid=8&field_kanda_tid=1&field_sarga_value=1) (“AMRITAKATAKA BY MADHAVA YOGIN”, “…श्रीमन्माधवयोगिविरचितया अमृतकतकाख्यव्याख्ययायुतम्…”)

\- [Dharmakutam](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/ecommentaries?field_commnetary_tid=9&field_kanda_tid=1&field_sarga_value=1) (“DHARMAKUTA BY TRYAMBAKA-RAJA MAKHI”)

\- [Siromani](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/ecommentaries?field_commnetary_tid=10&field_kanda_tid=1&field_sarga_value=1)(“SIROMANI BY SIVASAHAYA”, “रामायणशिरोमणिटीका”)

\- [Tattvadipika](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/ecommentaries?field_commnetary_tid=12&field_kanda_tid=1&field_sarga_value=1)(“TATTVADIPA BY MAHESVARA TIRTHA”, “…श्रीपरमहंसपरिव्राजकाचार्यश्रीनारायणतीर्थशिष्यमहेश्वतीर्थकृतौ श्रीरामायणतत्त्वदीपिकाख्यायां…”)

\- [Tilaka](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/ecommentaries?field_commnetary_tid=13&field_kanda_tid=1&field_sarga_value=1)(“TILAKA BY NAGOJI BHATTA”, “रामकृता तिलकाख्या टीका”)

Seem to be available only in Sanskrit:

\- [Bhushana](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/commentaries?language=dv&field_commnetary_tid=14&field_kanda_tid=1&field_sarga_value=1)

Seem to be listed but not yet available:

\- Tanisloki

  

There are some details about the project [here](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/about).  

It seems these were also available on the sister site[rsvpramayana.in](http://rsvpramayana.in) (which also listed “Govindarajiya”) but that site is offline now, with [very little](https://web.archive.org/web/20080417053524/http://rsvpramayana.in:80/) saved on the Internet wayback machine.I don't know how long these valuable sites will stay online, given what seems to the typical half-life of such sites :(
