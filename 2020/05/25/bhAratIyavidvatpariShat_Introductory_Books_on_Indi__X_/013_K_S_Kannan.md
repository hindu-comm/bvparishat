Your utterly neutral stand is to be appreciated, dear Gargeswari:

we align with people who share our prejudices.

*sugato yadi sarvajnaH kapilo neti kA pramA?*  

  

But there can also be certain general shared concerns during certain times and climes,

bearing which in mind one is often spurred to speak.

  

There indeed are many who easily fall under some brand or the other of  

what may broadly be called Breaking India forces.

Such people spare no effort in portraying a dismal and disparaging picture of ancient India.

When the same looks like an agenda, rather than issuing from an impartial approach,

one begins to suspect. Political affiliations and links also often betray these inclinations.

  

While this forum is not for explicitly discussing political issues,

when those at the helm of affairs do something to promote or demote

Sanskrit or its heritage, some concerns are inevitably raised/voiced.  

  

And everyone has the right to differ from everyone, after all.

  

The person who sought some information had some concerns.

Aligned thoughts can be expressed if it helps those concerns.

Others have not been denied the right to disagree with those concerns,

or give differing or opposing suggestions to the person  

who sought to help the seeker.
