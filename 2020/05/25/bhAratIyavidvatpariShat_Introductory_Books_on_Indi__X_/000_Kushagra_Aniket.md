Dear Scholars,

  

Today, an American friend of mine here in New York asked me for book recommendations to learn more about Indian history. Although he is well-educated and broadly familiar with Indian history, he wanted a more scholarly grounding in the subject.

  

To be honest, I was stumped by his question. The first book that came to my mind was Romila Thapar's Early India. However, I could not recommend it in goodconscience and deferred my response for a later time.Shri Rajiv Malhotra's and Dr. Meenakshi Jain's books also came to mind but they are usually not written as broad historical surveys.

  

Are there any introductory-level books on Indian history that are sympathetic to the counter-narrative/Hindu voices? I would be interested in a short book list (5-10 books) that would fit this requirement. Such a book list would be beneficial for anybody seeking an introduction into Indian history.

  

Thanks,

Kushagra
