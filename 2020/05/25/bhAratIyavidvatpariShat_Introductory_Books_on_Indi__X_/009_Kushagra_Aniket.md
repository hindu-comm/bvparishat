Thank you, respected scholars. Here is the compiled book list:

  

1\. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Series: History and Culture of the Indian People (11 volumes)

2\. The Wonder That Was India (A.L. Basham)

3\. South Indian History (Neelakantha Sastry)

4\. Land of the Seven Rivers (Sanjeev Sanyal)

5\. Ancient India (R.C. Majumdar)

6\. Medieval India (J.L. Mehta)

7\. Modern India (Shekhar Bandopadhyaya)

  

I have personally only read #2, #5 and #7.

  

Only after the reader has studied these books (could take a few years), we can recommend Romila Thapar, Upinder Singh, Bipin Chandra, etc.
