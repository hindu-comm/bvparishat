My problem was with her book

  

"Political Violence in Ancient India"

  

She said in an interview :

  

> 
> > About eight years ago, I suddenly realised — and it was really like a > flash that went through my head – that in spite of having studied, > taught, researched and written about ancient Indian history for over > 30 years, I had not realised that this history was shot through and > through with enormous violence. I had always ‘known’ the details — > that there were wars, power struggles, conflicts between the state and > forest people, class and caste oppression, crimes and punishment, > violence within the family, etc.. But there are ways and ways of > knowing. The realisation that hit me in a very powerful way eight > years ago is that the entire political history of ancient India is > based on political violence. >

I had to comment about this book on another list saying,

I did not like the way a non-existing view of ancient India was claimed to have been existing and a whole book was written to "counter " that non-existing view.
