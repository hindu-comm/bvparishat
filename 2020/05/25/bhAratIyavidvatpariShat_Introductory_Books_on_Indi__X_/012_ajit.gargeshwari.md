Is there a difference between prejudices, opinions and differing views or If one doesn't speak of historic narration one likes then the author is prejudiced. All are prejudiced then who are not prejudiced. Almost all are conditioned by events and readings in their life. If one writes not affected by the surroundings they live then it becomes either idealized view or imaginary.  

Whether of Bhartaratna P.V. Kane or any one else I don't support the idea of making allegations unless it can be proven by published materials by the writer themselves.

Children may have different views from parents.
