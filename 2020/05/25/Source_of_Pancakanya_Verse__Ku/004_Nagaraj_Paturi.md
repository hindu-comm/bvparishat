End note 1 has the following :

“Ahinik Sutravali”, cf. Bharatiya Sanskriti Kosh by Liladhar Sharma ‘Parvatiya’, (Delhi: Rajpal & Sons, 2nd edition, 1996) p. 502. Sharma also cites the Brahmanda Purana, 3.7.219, but has not seen it himself (personal communication). The verse was not found in the editions of this Purana available in Calcutta. Sudhirchandra Sarkar’s Pauranik Abhidhan (Calcutta: M.C. Sarkar & Sons, 1963) has an entry on “Panchakanya” (p.287) giving these five names. This shloka forms part of Orissa’s dying Mahari dance composition, kept alive by Padma Sri Guru Pankaj Charan Das, his disciple Dr. Ratna Roy and Ritha Devi. The Guru told Dr. Roy that the text was by Ratnakar Bandhu (personal communication). Dr. Jan E.M. Houben notes ([http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/ cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302&L=indology&](http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/%0Dcgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0302&L=indology&) D=1&F=P&O=D&P=8493) a similar sloka in the Brahmavaivarta Purana, Prakriti khanda (16.68), celebrating famous women as emanations of the goddesses Lakshmi, Sarasvati, Durga, Savitri, Radhika, etcetera. All these are aspects of the supreme Prakriti herself, not created by Brahma, and they are the cause of all that is auspicious. Three of the five kanyas (Ahalya, Tara, Mandodari) are mentioned here, along with Arundhati, Mena, Damayanti, Vedavati, Ganga and Yamuna (Manasa in the Bengal recension) – Ahalyarundhati mena tara mandodari para Damayanti vedavati ganga ca manasa tatha.
