Dear List,

  

Could any one help me in finding out the source of Pancaknayaverse and responding the following query of a senior colleague of mine, who I've copied in here.  

  

''I'd like to know if you've come across the well-known*pa\~ncakanyaa*
verse in any Sanskrit work written before the 19th century. Is it to be found in any collection of hymns such as*Stava-kavaca-mala*and the like? Is it current all over India, so far as you know? Does it occur in any printed book in any modern Indian language you can remember?''

  

  

With regards,

Niranjan Saha
