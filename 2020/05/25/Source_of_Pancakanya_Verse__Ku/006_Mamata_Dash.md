With regards to Vidvaans, I would like to know, whether any of our puranic or stotra scripture advice, not to have स्मरण  . it aways prescribe forपठन or श्रवण. May be the idea behind these 5 kanyAs, they are associated with some one other that the husband or more husbands. To give them the social status this verse has been formed.

I may be wrong.

With regards

Mamata Dash
