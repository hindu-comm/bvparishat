Dear Krishnaprasad,

  

Your effort can be useful for many as a reference tool.  

And precisely for that reason, it should be free from errors.

Please ensure that there is not a single error.

Or else, you will be misleading many.

  

Either drop this project, or do a good job.

Never try to console yourself saying it was *after all* a typo;

involve more (knowledgeable) people, and get proof-reading properly done.

Involve grammarians where grammar is involved.  

  

It does not matter much if you write a subhashita-book, and have a few typos.

But no dictionary, or for that matter no reference book, can afford to have errors.

  

I hope you catch the spirit of what I am saying.

Rather than disenthusing you, I am only saying -

take more time if you need, but do a fine job.

After all you are not writing a 500-page complex reference work.

Do a job you would always be proud of.  

  

Best wishes

KSKannan
