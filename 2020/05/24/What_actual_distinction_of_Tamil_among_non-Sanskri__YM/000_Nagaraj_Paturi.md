The discussion started with the use of Prakrits in the Sanskrit plays. Then came the mention of Natya Shastra and its instruction to include Prakrits in Sanskrit plays in Prof. Deshpande's post. In this post came the strange point that Dhvani in Sanskrit poetry came via Maharashtri poetry from Tamil poetry. In the ensuing discussion , it was argued that dhvani in Sanskrit poetry is a universal feature of all languages and all good poetry of all the world languages , so need not be traced to the poetry in a specific language. During the discussion, it was realized that this was a minor passing remark in Prof. George Hart's article.

  

In his main 'theory', Prof. George Hart was careful enough to state that 'It suggests that Kālidāsa was copying (sic) two traditions, one North Indian and one South Indian, to create a literature unlike what had gone before". He included the influence of the north Indian poetry tradition too on the emergence of Kalidadasa's and other classical Sanskrit poetry.

  

But what generally missed and generally misses the attention in such discussions is that even in premodern, ancient or medieval India, all Indian languages were not treated as Prakrits. There was always a category called Des'a Bhashas recognised by lakshaNa texts. Natya Shastra talks about Dravida (Tamil), Andhra (Telugu) as separate from Prakrits.

  

All the premodern grammars of Tamil, Kannada and Telugu treated the Des'ya/ native vocabulary in their languages as different from the Sanskrit-derived and Prakrit-derived words. While categorizing meters too, they treated Sanskrit-derived meters and the native meters of their own languages as two separate categories. Musicological treatises, sankeertana lakshaNa works etc. too while tracing the origins of the Indian classical music to Samaveda, never ignored the role of Desi , in fact gave a great significance to Desi in the emergence of the classical music that they were dealing with. Marga, Desi distinction and Marga-Desi mutual interface and influence was identified in graphic and plastic and all other fine arts too right from ancient treatises including Puranas.

  

That does not mean that the belief that Sanskrit is the mother of all (Indian ) languages did not exist. Ketana, the 13th century Telugu laakshaNika states that belief. He says, " janani samskritambu sakala bhaashalakunu". But we don't find such a statement in Andhra S'abda ChintamaNi (a pre-16th century Telugu grammar composed in Sanskrit medium) or Chinnaya Suri's BaalavyaakaraNamu (19th century).

  

Dr Chilukuri Narayana Rao, a gigantic scholar of the early university days in Telugu , strenuously tried to derive all Telugu words from Sanskrit , while majority of the Telugu scholars exposed to modern education went with the Dravidian family theory about Telugu. But he belonged to a small section of his kind.Such resistance to Dravidian family theory was there in Tamil and Kannada too. But there too they were a small section. These scholars in Telugu, Kannada or Tamil did not represent any older tradition because we don't see such attempts of deriving all the native words from Sanskrit in pre-modern south Indian literary history.

  

It is true that the non-scholarly, uncritical modern educated Indians influenced by the modern education- brought historical approach to every human and social topic in their school assignment type writings do start the write up with two origin discussions one starting with " during Vedic times....." or " in vedas ....." and the other " during the primitive man's time...... ", " the primitive man used to......... " placing both in the same write up without realizing that the two
belonged two different models of historical approach. But these naive writings can not be taken as representing the modern south Indian or Indian scholarly tradition.

  

As such, it is misrepresenting to stereotype all premodern and modern south Indian traditional scholars as deriving/tracing all things native from Vedas and /or Sanskrit. This attitude is reflected in Prof. George Hart's statement , "This theory has many important consequences. For one thing, it has been common to trace Indian literatures back to the Vedas."

  

What missed the attention of many modern scholars is that the Desi within Marga-Desi need not always be limited to the south Indian scenario. Vedic-non-Vedic/folk scenario is reflected in the early Veda mantras itself. This was the scenario all over the Indic sub-continent. Prof. George Hart says, "Therefore we may theorize that the Mahārāştrī poets whose poems occur in the Satt**asaī** (for it is extremely unlikely that all the poems in that anthology are by one man) are ultimately copies of the oral compositions of bards who lived with them. This accounts for the earthy flavour and folk quality of the poems." Thisearthy flavour and folk quality must have been part of all the life, culture, art and literature of the non-Vedic / folk life that existed all over the Indic subcontinent along side the Vedic. They could have been the speakers of laguages of Mundarian and other language families. Add to this folk groups of the Vedic society itself , speaking several Prakrits in the major part of the Indic sub-continent. The Vedic-non-Vedic/ folk cultural admixture / mutual influence that resulted in the emergence of the later classical culture not just in literature but even temple architecture, iconography, art, music and dance must have had contributions from not just the south Indian non-Vedic/folk people and their culture but even from all other Desi / earthy/ folk people from the Prakrit speakers of the Vedic society and the non-Vedic/folk people from the remaining parts of the Indic sub-continent. As far as features of Indian languages is concerned, such an interaction among Indian languages leading to a convergence and sub-strata among them has been identified in the theory of "India as a Linguistic Area " by Prof. M B Emeneau. I presented a research paper " India as a Folklore Area" (1996). We should be able to establish such convergence and sub-strata in all other aspects of Indian culture including literature, poetry, art, sculpture, architecture etc., with participation from Vedic, Vedic-Prakrit, southern non-Vedic and northern non-Vedic strands of all these.

  

If you look at the studies of Sattasai by Telugu scholars, they keep pointing out a very big amount of Telugu words such as Atta, Potta etc. in the book. They talk about the folk songs and other folk cultural aspects in the gaathaas to be the Telugu folk songs and Telugu folk cultural aspects reflected in that Prakrit work. Was Maharashtri the Prakrit spoken by the Telugu people ? Telugu scholars do not say that. Wasn't there an earthy, folk life of the Maharashtri-speaking folk people ? Was that not getting reflected in the book ? if answer to this question is yes, then Sattasai should be seen as reflecting the earthy and folk life of the Maharashtri-Telugu-Kannada geographical and cultural complex.

  

Prof. Romilla Thapar traces some aspects of the narrative of Kalidadsa's Abhijnana Sakuntalam to the north Indian folk versions of Sakuntala. It is not clear if Prof. George Hart included folk versions of Mahabharata stories and other folk poetic aspects of north India when he said Kalidasa copied from north Indian traditions. But we should be able to trace different aspects of Sakuntalam to various sources such as Veda mantras, Itihasas, Puranas , older laukika Sanskrit literature and north Indian folk literary and cultural traditions apart from Maharashtri influence through which there could have been a south Indian influence that Prof. George Hart mentions.

  

Going with a model ofconvergence and sub-strata in all aspects of Indian culture including literature, poetry, art, sculpture, architecture etc., with participation from Vedic, Vedic-Prakrit, southern non-Vedic and northern non-Vedic strands of all these does not mean discounting the distinction of Tamil in the emergence of this pan-Indian convergent cultural complex.

  

Though we can speak of literary , artistic and cultural traditions of
non-Vedic, non-Sanskrit and Vedic-Prakrit, that could have been as advanced as the Vedic and Sanskritic ones, it is only in the ancient Tamil literature that there is a tangible, well established, elaborate evidence and documentation of a non-Sanskritic tradition in poetry, poetics and other aspects of culture. It is only later to Tamil that Kannada moved from the Sanskrit Prakrit medium of academic and litarary tradition to a mother tongue/ regional language medium. Telugu was even later. It is this unparalleled feature of Tamil tradition that missed the notice of Prof. George Hart in his article being discussed.
