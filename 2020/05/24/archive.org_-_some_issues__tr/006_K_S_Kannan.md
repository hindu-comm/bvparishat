DLI spoiled the case too much.

It would be another mega-project perhaps to rectify the DLI errors

\- or even just rectifying the titles of the books.

  

And it is good that some books have multiple uploads

\- at least some upload may be less erratic!

  

It is all like the traditional saying:

Have many kids; who knows, one of them may even go astray!

accompanied by

Have many kids; who knows, one of them at least may perform some noble act! :

  

एष्टव्या बहवः पुत्रा यद्येकोऽपि सुरां पिबेत् !।

एष्टव्या बहवः पुत्रा यद्येकोऽपि गयां व्रजेत् !! ॥
