And one could take the other logic, like this doha:

  

पूत कपूत तो क्यों धन संचय ।

पूत सपूत तो क्यों धन संचय ।।

  

If son is bad, why hoard wealth (he will abuse it)

If son is good, why hoard wealth (he will earn on his own)

  

And for once, I can say, it was meant as son. Because generally a daughter won't abuse wealth! 😀😀

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
