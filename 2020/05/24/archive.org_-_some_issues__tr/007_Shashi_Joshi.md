I assumed that people do download the pdf files.

  

Reading on archive website itself for any significant amount of time is painful unless one projects it on a large screen monitor.

  

My suggestion was for downloaded PDFs .

  

When you switch to 2 page mode in acrobat reader, normally it will show page 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 ... which is not how a book will open. A book will have 1, 2-3, 4-5, ...

So, acrobat reader allows you to do this as well, setting for showing cover page separately.

  

Between the two modes, one of them will suffice the need of Prof Kannan.

  

But, if suddenly some blink pages missing from inside then one has to switch the view mode.  
  

  
Thanks,
