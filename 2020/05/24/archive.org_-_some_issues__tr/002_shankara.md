Sir,

  

As you are well aware a large number of Sanskrit books at [archive.org](http://archive.org) are from Digital Library of India project.  

  

Apart from this, the major digitizers are [eGangotri Digital Preservation Trust](https://egangotri.wordpress.com/) and [Sri Gargeswari Digital Foundation](https://archive.org/details/@sri_gargeshwari_digital_foundation). The co-ordinators of both these orgs are members of BVP. Let us hope they find time to join this discussion.  

  

regards  
shankara
