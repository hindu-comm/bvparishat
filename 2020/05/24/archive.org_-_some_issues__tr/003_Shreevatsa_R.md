For what it's worth, for cases where books appear on [archive.org](http://archive.org) with left/right pages mixed up, there are two workarounds:

  

1\. Switch to single-page view. Then, viewing adjacent pages does not require turning the page but simply scrolling up and down. The view can also be sufficiently zoomed out so that two consecutive pages are simultaneously visible, if the text is still readable at that size. If not, one can always open the same book in another browser window and put the two browser windows side-by-side, each scrolled to display a single page (and occupying half one's screen width).

  

or, much simpler:

  

2\. Download the book as PDF from [archive.org](http://archive.org). Any good PDF reader has options to display pages in two-page view with or without the first page being treated as cover page.

  

Also, apart from all the other uploaders, there are a few books digitized by the Internet Archive themselves (e.g. [these](https://archive.org/details/university_of_toronto)). Some of these seem to have issues with the metadata where characters with diacritical marks are dropped (e.g. from the first page I saw many instances of "Abhidhānarājendraḥ : kośa" turned into "Abhidhnarjendra : koa"). This looks like a software problem (some intermediate system ate non-ASCII characters) rather than human error at the time of manually entering the title.
