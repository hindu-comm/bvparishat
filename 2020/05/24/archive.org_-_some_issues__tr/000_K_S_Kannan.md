In Archive.org, we see dozens of books which are carelessly scanned  

\- recto as verso and vice versa. That is to say, the right page is shown as the left page,  

and the left as the right. This is more easily discerned by the fact that  

the odd-numbered page, which should naturally appear as the right-hand-side page,  

is appearing as the left-hand-page; and vice versa.

  

Actually this is very inconvenient. A good many times,  

the author will have given the original Sanskrit text on the LHS (left-hand-side),  

and the translation on the RHS. This convenience gets disabled.

You see the text on the RHS, and for the translation you have turn over the page (each time)!

The author's intention is defeated.

  

This is also happening, perhaps, on account of some pages left blank (intentionally).

Possibly, the scanner imagines he is "saving" the number of pages thereby!  

  

Even the page numbers are generally marked similarly to suit searching:  

the odd number appears at the RHT (right-hand-top), and the even number at the LHT.

This also gets disturbed, inconveniencing searching thereby.  

  

Apart from these, there are numerous errors  

in entering even the titles of the books.

  

Now the question is what remedial measures can be taken in future at least.  

For that to be done, is it not necessary to know who are involved  

in uploading the books, and why? Do they do it as a matter of personal joy,  

or is it a commercial activity? Is it funded by some private organisations  

or by the government(s)? How are the uploaders to be sensitised?

  

While it is good that more and more books are getting uploaded  

(and something is better than nothing),  

is it not also important that things should be done better?  

Isn't some training needed for those who are involved herein?

Who should train them, and whom should they train?

Is there none to hold anybody responsible at any stage?

No accountability? No reviews?  

  

Or is it wiser to be unbothered, as per the adage:

everybody's business is, after all, nobody's business?
