Sir,

First of all, we should thank all those who are uploading on [archive.org](http://archive.org), no matter the quality.

Then, for each document, you can find who uploaded it, in the document page itself (bottom right).

There seems to be no way to contact a contributor though.

  

If for some PDF which is critical, you do find an issue like page shifting, on a case by case, one can correct it by inserting extra page using a PDF editor software. (Free and paid are available).

Then one has to upload it as a new doc though. Unless the original uploader does it him/her self.

  

If you have specific needs, do let me know via direct mail, and I will help you with the PDF editing.

But, I don't [archive.org](http://archive.org) itself has any restrictions on what you can upload. Google, Microsoft or the million books projects who scanned docs, they may have had guidelines for scanning. But I guess some slips must have happened.  

  
  

Thanks,  

\~ Shashi
