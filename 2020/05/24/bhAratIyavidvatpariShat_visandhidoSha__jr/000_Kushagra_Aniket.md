Respected Scholars and Members,

  

I have a query regarding the visandhi dosha (विसन्धिदोष) in kavya.

  

Is sandhicompulsoryin poetry? The answer seems to be no, per the rule "संहितैकपदे नित्या नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः।नित्या समासे वाक्ये तु सा विवक्षामपेक्षते॥" and the example ofधिक् तां च तं च मदनं च इमां च मां च.

  

However, if sandhi is not done in kavya (similar to the example above), would it constitute a dosha, according to Mammata and others? Are there any limits or exceptions to this dosha? Is it also a dosha in prose?

  

Thanks,

Kushagra
