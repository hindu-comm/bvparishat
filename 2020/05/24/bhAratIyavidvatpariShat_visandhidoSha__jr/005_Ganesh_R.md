Thank you Prof.Kannan Sir,

Dear Sri. Kushagra,  

  

If one is hellbent on maintaining visandhi, no rule need to be followed:) We do have modern poems falling into the category of verse libre where metre is not a constraint. But the basic purpose of sandhi is to avoid shruti-kaTutva and aid for smooth pronunciation. It is quite objective too. There may be rare cases which may stand as exceptions to this rule. As we all know shruti-kaTutva is one among the blemishes of classical poetry. Those who don't bother such cautions can always go ahead in their chosen way. Incidentally, we do see quite a few writings even in this forum itself which flout most of the meaningful rules of good versification.

  

With best wishes

  

Ganesh
