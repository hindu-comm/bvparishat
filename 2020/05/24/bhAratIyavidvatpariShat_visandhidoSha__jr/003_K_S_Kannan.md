Theoretically speaking, guNa-s can become doSha-s, and vice versa  

\- provided there are appropriate circumstances.

Pl. look into Dandin, Mammata, Rajashekhara and Bhoja  

for a detailed discussion on this very issue, the last especially.

  

There is this famous verse which begins with  

*na saMhitAm vivakShAmi ....*

where it is shown when it is ok if sandhi is missed in poetry.

  

On the other hand, and as another extreme, I have seen an instance of sandhi taking place  

between *pUrvArdha* and *uttarArdha* of a verse - yes, in Sanskrit (not Kannada etc.)!
