Very true, Dr. Ganesh.

Rarely *visandhi* is permitted. And even in permitted cases,  

it is cautioned that if this happens repeatedly  

it becomes inexcusable.

  

I guess when we say *Rgveda-samhitA*, it is the *samhitA-pATha* that is intended

by the word *samhitA*. It is possibly a mistranslation (begun by Westerners ?)  

to translate *samhitA* here as a mere "collection \[of hymns\]"  

\- so as to use it as a tool of further misinterpretation  

  

There may be other contexts where the sense of collection may fit.
