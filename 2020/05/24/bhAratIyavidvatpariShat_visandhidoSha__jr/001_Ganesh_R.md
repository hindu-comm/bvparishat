In a prose poem, ie., gadyakaavyam, visandhi will not be a blemish. However, in any verse poem, ie., padyakaavyam/geetakaavyam/verse portions in plays and champuu-s, it will be a serious blemish as metre will get derailed badly and chandobhanga is, at times, treated as a greater flaw than the grammatical lapses. Even in prose, visandhi at every instance will be too jarring to the ears and eventually makes it hard to read.
