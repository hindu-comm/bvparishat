One often encounters *visandhi* constructions  

in Itihasa-s and Purana-s.

  

And secondly, when a quotative *iti* follows,

some margin for *sandhi* rules may be allowed  

between the appellative and the *iti*.

Of course, such constructions must be attested in more numbers  

before it can be strongly asserted.
