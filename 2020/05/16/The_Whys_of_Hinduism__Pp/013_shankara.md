Namaste,

  

Why? Hinduism Defined Scientifically and Rationally by Shastrarth Maharathi Pt. Madhavacharya Shastri  

<https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/why-hinduism-defined-scientifically-and-rationally-IDF694/>

  

If we ignore the generic name, the following book by Linda Johnson is a good one. It covers almost all aspects of Hinduism and the author has portrayed Hinduism without prejudice.

shankara
