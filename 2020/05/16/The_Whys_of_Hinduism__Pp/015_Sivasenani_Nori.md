There is this book called Hindu Dharma by Kanchi Paramacharya, also available on the website of Kanchi peetham (<http://www.kamakoti.org/misc/hindudharma.html>). It combines a simple presentation with authenticity and depth. It is also very exhaustive and organized along the scheme of vidyasthanas (four Vedas, six angas, and eight Sastras).
