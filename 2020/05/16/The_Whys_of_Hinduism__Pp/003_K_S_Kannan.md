Dear Shankara,

I have not read that book yet.

*Sanatana Dharma* by Sw. Bharati Krishna Tirtha  

is interesting and useful, at least in some aspects.

  

Despite theosophical leanings, another set of 3 short volumes,  

also called *Sanatana Dharma* (from Adyar),  

should also make interesting reading.

  

If you want more details about these books, I can send.

Must be available in [archives.org](http://archives.org).  

  

I guess you are asking me for the sake of recommendation

to some beginner.

  

Regards

KSKannan
