Sir,

  

Thanks very much for sharing your prefered introductions to Hinduism. I am aware of the first one. Please share details of the book published by Adyar Library.

  

You are right. My question was for the sake of beginners, who sometimes ask for books on Hinduism. I have read Hindi version 'Why' party. Hindi version is more detailed and is in 2 volumes. I found it comprehensive and useful.  

  

It is the first volume of a Trilogy on Hinduism, the other two being Purana Digdarshan and Veda Digdarshan.  

  

regards  
shankara
