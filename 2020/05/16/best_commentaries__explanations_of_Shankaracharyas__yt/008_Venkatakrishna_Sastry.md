Namaste Acharya Pandurangi ji



Thanks for triggering a interesting thread using the ' text centric perspective' as a ' naiyayika'. Learned schoalrs can help to improve the basic thought in this sketchy response.



I submit my little and limited understanding of the ' intention of Acharya Shankara', which seems not to be different from the pointers provided by Acharya Madhva in the talavakara upanishad bhashya.



Each upanishad needs to be taken on merits of its context; ' Ekasutrataa' is for the ' Tattva' and 'Darshana'. Eka-sutrataa is NOT for ' yoga-abhyasa-anushaasana'. 



The tattva-darshana of all upanishads is aligned to 'Brahma- Tattva'. The yoga-abhyaasa-anushaasana' in each text varies.

Example : Chandogya, Bruhadaranyaka gives several upaasana's, each unique, each contextual ; yet teaching is all aligned to One goal.



**1. Some clariifcatory observations before proceeding further. **



 (1. A) Both Acharyas recognize the text as a advanced yoga guidance ( which, in the model of Patajali Yoga sutra, falls in the realm of post Yogaagna Samadhi and moving beyond Siddhi of thrid chapter towards Kaivlya). This simply means that the instruction is not amenable for worldly logical discourse and dispute.



 (1.B) Acharya Shankara seems to focus on 'anushaasana' part : instruction appropriate to the practitioner by need and potential ;

Acharya Madhva seems to focus on the ' identitification of Competence of the seeker ( adhikaara-yogyataa , taaratamya) to explain the text. 



 The backdrop to understand Talavakaropanishad is a dialogue-discourse between Brahma and Vishnu, to know the ' Tattva - Truth of That'.

 The targetted explanation of ' Tat' covers dynamcis of
'manas, prana and senses'. ( Print Page 26: Prof. KTPandurangi-

**2. Coming speciifc to Acharya Shankaras intention, the following extracts may help to provide clarity on Acharya Shankaras intention .
**



 (Source of extracts: <https://archive.org/details/KenaUpanishadWithShankaraBhasyaAndAnandagiriTika/page/n1/mode/2up>)



2.1) Who is competent to puruse the teachings in this upanishad ? (Adhikaara -Yogayataa - Anushaasanam) :

The upanishad teachings are for the one who has 'Vishuddha-Sattva' , Nishkaama, Virakta. The seeker is interested in knowing the ultimate truth of ' the processes'. The seeker is NOT in the 'Sannyasa' ashrama.
The seeker is exiting from samsaara, through vana-prastha phase'.

2.2) The reason for providing instructions to seeker who fulfils the condition above is to facilitate yoga-process- practice. The goal set for practice is 'samsaara-beeja-naasha'.

2.3) The practice leads seeker towards ' sannyasa' through progresive stages.

2.4) The teaching is traditional. The teaching can be understood ONLY through the ' aacharyopadesha'.

Self-Reading and Logical interpretation ( na- tarkatah) , lecturing (pravachana), - does not help to get the essence of teaching.

2.5) The seeker after receiving the instructions does not go by blind faith.

The seeker practices and explores self-experience. Logic and experimentation is an integral part of this process.

Then he takes this entire detail to Acharya and gets a review -validation .

2.6) The analysis of the text is ' yathaa-yogam'. The method of presentation as question and answer is a technique and pedagogy.

The Yoga practice directives : Tapas, Swadhyaaya, yajna, Ishwara pranidhana etc; are for 'satva-shuddhi-samskaara'.

When sufficient purity is attained, which may take several
cycles of birth and death for the seeker , the doors open and light shines. 

' Paapa-kshaya' is a test point. Alternative term is ' Moksha-yogayataa'.

Call it satva shuddhi, Krupaa, anugraha as one prefers to.

I hope these snippets from Shankara bhashya help to bring out the
intention of Shankaracharya. The contradiction appears when one mixes up the anlytics of philosophy ( tattva -siddhanta) and the practice instructions ( yoga- abhyaasa) that leads to the ' tattva-darshana'.
