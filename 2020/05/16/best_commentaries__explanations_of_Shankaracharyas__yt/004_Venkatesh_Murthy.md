Namaste

  

The best way to understand the Bhashyas is to keep in mind the Satta Traividhya. Sometimes they explain from Vyavaharika stand and sometimes from Paramarthika stand. The reader will get confused if he cannot see from which stand the explanation is. Example, when they are explaining Jagat Srushti they will explain as if the Srushti is really happening and Panchikarana with the five elements and everything. When explaining Ekam Eva Adviteeyam Brahma they will explain there is no Jagat at all to consider.

  

The confusion is because they will not say, 'Now we will explain from Vyavaharika stand' and 'Now we will explain from Paramarhika stand'.
