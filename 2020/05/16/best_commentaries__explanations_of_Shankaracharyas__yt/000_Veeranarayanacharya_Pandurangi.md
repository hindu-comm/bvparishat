Dear All

I am trying to read Shankaracharyas Bhashyas on Upanishads. however facing problems in reading his real intention in each and every sentence of Upanishads.

if anybody has written exhaustivecommentary translations explanations on Bhashyas in any language English Hindi SamskritKannada etc.

  

there are many translations published by popular advaita institutions meant for laymen. These books may help laymen. not scholars.

  

I need recommendations from advaita vedanta experts to depend on which books to understand shankaracharya.
