Sir

  

My M. Phil was on English translations of Vedanta. I had specifically chosen the bhashya of Sankaracharya on Chatussuutri and compared eight translations minutely. Amongst those, the best was by Swami Gambhirananda. He has translated most of the Upanishads as well.

  

That said, Swami Gambhirananda was a follower of Sankaracharya and for followers many contradictions that seem apparent to non-followers do not even 'appear'. For a critical point of view, George Thibaut would be the best, but he only translated the Brahmasutrabhashya not the Upanishadbhashya. Still considering that the Brahmasutras cover some 2,000 important senteces from Vedanta, for most sentences amenable to multiple explanations, George Thibaut's translations of both Saankarabhashya and Sribhashya may be consulted. The prefatory material to the translation of Sribhashya contains a critical evaluation; for the record, Thibaut thinks that Sankaracharya imposed his own system upon the Brahmasutras, whose intention is closer to the explication of Ramanujacharya. I believe that this is due to the influence of a Benares Pandit who clarified many points to Thibaut and the objectives of the imperial project. Sir Radhakrishnan wrote on all the Upanishads, but sort of independently while following thethought of Sankaracharya by and large - though he does differ from Acharya's thought as well. Another interesting comparison would be with the bhashya of Rangaramanujacharya; I studied the commentay on a few short Upanishads and was amazed that by and large he follows Sankaracharya, but differs in the interpretation of what may be called the bhedavaakyas and abhedavaakyas (most of these are discussed in various adhikaranams of the Brahmasutras, if not being the vishaya vaakyasthemselves).

  

Finally, if BVP management allows, if you post the contradictions that you see here, may be others could respond. Usually BVP does not have the bitterness of discussions between Advaitins vs Dvaitins seen in other groups, where usually far more heat is generated than light. After a dozen (apparent) contradictions or so, the pattern usually becomes clear and rest would not usually need discussion (the other instances tend to be slightly different manifestations of patterns seen in the first few deep dives).
