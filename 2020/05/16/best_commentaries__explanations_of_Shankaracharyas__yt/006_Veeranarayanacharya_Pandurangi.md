the question is very simple. I do not need mere translations. I need something elaborate explanations patching/ explaining logic of each sentence and relation between preceding and succeeding sentences, if they exist.

  

one of my friends advaita professor told me that "no such saangatya is shown everywhere, it is just like that". I just wanted to enquire here about availablity of any such works.

  

offcourse, trividha satta is there. I understand very well. But there should be vyayaharika resolution, not pratibhasika.  

  

I need not show what and where and why contradictions arise. it is not a place for it, neither I want to write about it in future. my query is to understand what logic he has for the text he is commenting.
