In this link of Advaitasharada <https://tinyurl.com/ycu9lqs2> all the texts are available. One can open the texts. For example if one wants to read the Brahma sutra bhashya along with Bhashya ratna prabha, one can open this text and on that page one will first see the Bhashya first paragraph and the word 'vyakhya' embedded below that para. On clicking the vyakhya one will see the vyakhya for that paragraph. This method can be followed to read the Bhamati and the Nyayanirnaya commentaries separately. The Panchapadika of Padmapadacharya is there for a part of the Bhashya. An adhikaranaartha sangraha shloka type commentary by Bharati Tirtha (of Vidyaranya time) called 'vaiyasika nyaya maala' is also available.

  

The other option is to have the hard copy of the book. Motilal Banarsidas, etc. have brought out books which have all three commentaries together on each page. Pdf's are also available.

  

For Upanishad Bhashyas For all ten bhashyas, Anandagiri teeka is available. For Taittiriya, additionally a very good Vanamaalaa teeka is also there.

  

For Gita Bhashya, Anandagiri is available.

  

All these are available in Advaitasharadalink. These are not for download and one can read them on the system.

  

In printed books additionally Dhanapati Suri's Bhashyotkarsha Dipika is there.  

  

These are the commentarial texts that are studied traditionally along with the Bhashya.
