With particular reference to Ishavasya Upanishad, there was a long discussion on this forum a few yearsback on mantras 9, 10, 12, where the bhashya was discussed in the light of Anandagiri's gloss. According to the Bhashya, certain mantras are about Jnana/Jnani/ paramarthika satyam, some about upasana and brahmaloka praapti, some about samucchaya. Unless one is familiar with the global picture of Advaita on these topics, certain parts of the Bhashya are bound to be unclear.
Repeated study of other Upanishad bhashya, Sutra bhashya etc. will give one great clarity. This is often experienced when one revisits a particular upanishad bhashya after such an engagement with other bhashyas.
