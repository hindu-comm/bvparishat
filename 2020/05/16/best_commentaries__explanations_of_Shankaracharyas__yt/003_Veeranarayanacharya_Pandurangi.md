thanks,

I have got all these in my disposal. Advaita sharada is very much helpfulin finding words and quotations.

I am finding it difficult to understand what is shankaracharya's intention. there is apparent contradiction between Shankara's theory and explanation. I thought somebody would have noticed and given some explanation or patched it up. I need detailed explanations how shankara is treating this or that. for example there is contradiction in Isha upanishatthat some shlokas are merely for ignorants and some for gnorants. more we dive deep more problems. I need a detailed explanation word by word line by line. what is the logic of each line and word. For a Naiyayika it is necessary. otherwise it looks blurry for him. help me if you have something.

i wonderhow people are reading all these works without such works all along.

I dontwant to be lead somebody else patha also.
