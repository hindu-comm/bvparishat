I had started learning Spanish a year ago, left it in between. But I used to learn it through a Sanskritized way.

  

Like learning Dhatus like Ir Gatau, Hablar Bhashane, Entender Avabodhane etc.

  

Dhaturoop too = Va Van/ Vas Vais/ Voy Vamos// in this way I conjugate it and learnt the Rupas. Where prathama and uttama of both are opposite, but I conjugate even Spanish Keeping He/She form as Prathama.

  

I also translate Sanskrit parts into Spanish. The advantage was that Spanish constriction would be slightly different from English, but Sanskrit sentences can be written in various forms so I had less confusion.

  

Also many forms lIke Rucha have exact forms like Gusta. Me Gusta = मे रोचते। But an English speaker takes alot of time to understand how I like = Me Gusta and not He likes. (As Gusta is Prathama Purusha).

  

If there be made a book for Sanskrit speakers to learn Latin/Spanish, it will be very easy to grasp.

  

Regards
