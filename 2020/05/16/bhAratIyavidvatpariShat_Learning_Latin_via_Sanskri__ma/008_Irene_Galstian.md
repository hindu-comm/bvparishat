Even though learning Latin from English may be a bit of a long way round, Loeb Classical Library parallel texts are useful for learning on sentence level, where you absorb the habits of the language. Loeb translations are made by different scholars, so you'd be exposed to several translation styles, as well as different epochs in Latin literature. Whether you learn Latin from Sanskrit or from English, eventually you'd have to deal with Latin on its own terms if you want to be able to read texts in it. Reading Vergil or Ovid is different from reading, say, medieval Christian theologians or Spinoza.
