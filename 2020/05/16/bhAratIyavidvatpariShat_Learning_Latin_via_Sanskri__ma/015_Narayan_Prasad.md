\<\< Even English as spoken by its native American or British speakers does not have the टवर्ग ध्वनि.... So the rendering of the English "et cetera" asएट् सेट्रा works fine for Indian English, but not as English pronounced in America or UK.>\>  

  

Sir, I have been only to UK in 1988-89 on UNFellowship. I stayed at Oxford.

  

I did not have any problem in communicating with the British people, except with those coming from North of England (e.g. Liverpool) or Scotland. In case of Liverpool people, I had to ask even spelling of certain words, which were completely unintelligible to me. In the institute where I was sent, there was a person from Scotland. He was not *speaking* English, but *whispering*. So I had to listen to him very carefully.

  

By chance, in 1989 itself the 2nd edition of Oxford English Dictionary had come out in 20 vols. (wt. 62 pounds). I was thrilled to see a copy of these volumes in a shop.

  

My guide was from South England. He always pronounced my surname प्रसाद as प्रसाड. I told him to pronounce d like द, as in "the". He tried, but could not succeed. Another Englishman once pronounced Urdu asउर्डू and ittook quite some time toguess what he meant byउर्डू.

  

One Englishman once visited BORI. We talked inEnglish only. At the end he said: "उड्या पाहू". I could not immediately make out what he meant byउड्या. After some time I guessed, what he meant was:उद्या पाहू.

  

Of course, the American English is slightly different from the British English and sometimes I face difficulty in understanding the American accent. The pronunciation of "r" is completely different, which appears to me like the Tamil ழ or the Malayalam ഴ.

  

Regards

Narayan Prasad
