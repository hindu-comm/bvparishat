Sanskrit to Latin translations:

आसीद् राजा नलो नाम वीरसेनसुतो बली...  

→

Fuit rex, Nalus nomine, Viraseni-filius validus...  

and so on -- from Franz Bopp's*Nalus: carmen Sanscritum e Mahabharato*, the Nalopākhyāna from the Mahabharata with a Latin translation: it is the example given on the Latin Wikipedia's page “Slocus”. Apparently this work is the reason the Nalopakhyana is still ([www.jstor.org/stable/24631799](http://www.jstor.org/stable/24631799)) encountered by Sanskrit students in the West.

<https://archive.org/details/mahabharatiepiso00nalu/page/n21/mode/2up>or<https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_CG0MD5aDzKoC/page/n19/mode/2up>(facing pages)  

  

A few other Sanskrit to Latin translations (the translations are at the back of the books):  

•<https://archive.org/details/bhartriharissent00bhar/page/n4/mode/2up>(*Bhartriharis Sententiae et carmen quod chauri nomine circumfertur eroticum*) The3 śatakas of Bhartṛhari and thecaura-pañcāśikā. By Peter von Bohlen.  

•<https://books.google.com/books?id=PDEpAAAAYAAJ>(*Ritusanhara: id est Tempestatum cyclus; carmen sanskritum, Kâlidâso adscriptum*). Also by Peter von Bohlen.

•<https://books.google.com/books?id=TKUIAAAAQAAJ> (*Urvasia, fabula, ed., interpretationem et notas adjecit R. Lenz*) Maybeinteresting asprose dialogue is translated.

(Might be good to reupload from Google Books to [archive.org](http://archive.org) if they aren't there already.)

  

There's alsoBopp's Sanskrit to Latin dictionary<https://archive.org/details/glossariumsanscr00boppuoft>(*Glossarium Sanscritum in quo omnes radices et vocabula usitatissima explicantur et cum vocabulis Graecis, Latinis, Germanicis, Lithuanicis, Slavicis, Celticis comparantur*)

  

There may be more...

  

In the other direction there is Bacon's Novum Organum in Sanskrit (<https://books.google.com/books?id=los-AAAAcAAJ>,<https://books.google.com/books?id=lnkOAAAAQAAJ>) though this is not a translation from Latin but a commentary based on some English version.
