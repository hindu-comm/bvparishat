Many thanks to respected scholars on this email chain. One learned scholar has suggested reading the Bible for this purpose.

  

This is a good idea because the Biblewas translated into Sanskrit some time ago and also has a standard Latin translation. These translations are available on the internet. A line by line comparative reading of Latin, Sanskrit, and the King James versions promises to be helpful.
