In that case, Hebrew Bible narratives would be helpful to start with, e.g. Samuel, Ruth, Esther, Jonah. Samuel is pretty long though.

I suggest staying away from the New Testament, at least in the beginning, since the peculiar wording of Christian doctrinal terminology can distract you from the task you’ve set yourself of learning Latin.

You might also consider taking a quick look at how and when the Vulgate, KJV, and Sanskrit translations of the Bible came about.
