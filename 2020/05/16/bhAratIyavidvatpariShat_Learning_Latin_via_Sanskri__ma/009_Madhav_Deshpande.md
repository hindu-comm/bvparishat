This discussion reminded me of an interesting recent phone call that I received from a Marathi Muslim family living here in the Bay Area of California. Their son in the 10th or 11th grade had been studying Latin and Greek in the high school for a fewyears and he was interested in studying Sanskrit to see the connection of Sanskrit with these languages. In our face-time conversation, the boy seemed very enthusiastic and had already done some online exploration of information about Sanskrit and its connections to other languages, and especially to Marathi which his mother speaks. I said I would be very happy to teach him Sanskrit using Zoom or some other distance learning tool. Will see if this materializes.
