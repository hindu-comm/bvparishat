Thank you for all the helpful suggestions. Prof. Apte's book appears to be a great model.

  

The ideal resource would be a similar book in English on Latin composition and grammar that provides parallels with Sanskrit. To that, an appendix of declensions and conjugations could be added. Currently, I find myself reviewing the Latin conjugation tables, reading their meanings in English, and then comparing them to the Sanskrit dhatu tables in my mind for understanding.
