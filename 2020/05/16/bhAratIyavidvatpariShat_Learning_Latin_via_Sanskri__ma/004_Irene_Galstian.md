There's good and potentially less good news.

  

The good news is that apparently one Fridericus Rosen translated Rgveda into Latin in 1828:

The rest is less good news, since you might have to choose mantras where Mr Rosen would've been least likely to offer outlandish interpretations or get confused.

  

Other than this, I've tried searching WorldCat, but no textbooks turned up so far.
