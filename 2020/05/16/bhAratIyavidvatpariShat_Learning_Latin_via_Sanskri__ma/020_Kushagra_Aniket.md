As a novitiate into Latin, I also made an observation about the language and was wondering if the experts in this group, especially those who are biased towards Sanskrit, sympathize with it:

  

When I study Latin grammar, it appears as if somebody passed proto-Sanskrit through thelinguisticequivalent of the statistical technique of "dimension reduction," i.e. he traded some of the flexibility and versatility of Sanskrit for the simplicity and accessibility of Latin. However, in this process, he encountered new complexities, prompting him to create additional rules and exceptions. A comparison of cases/declensions and verb conjugations in the two languages would illustrate my point.

  

How would Panini react if he had to systematize Latin, instead of Sanskrit? This is not to take away from the rich vocabulary and literary traditions of Latin. However, Latin scholars have studied and evaluated Sanskrit for more than three centuries. I would be interested in seeing the products of "reversing the gaze."
