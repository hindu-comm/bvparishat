Dear Narayan Prasad Ji,

  

  Even English as spoken by its native American or British speakers does not have the टवर्ग ध्वनि. In its native pronunciation, the English t is aVoiceless alveolar stop, and it is not a मूर्धन्य sound as in many Indian languages, or in the Indian pronunciation of English. So the rendering of the English "et cetera" asएट् सेट्रा works fine for Indian English, but not as English pronounced in America or UK. I had to learn this the hard way after coming to the US in 1968, when the Puneri English that I was speaking was not comprehensible to American English speakers, and theirs to me.
