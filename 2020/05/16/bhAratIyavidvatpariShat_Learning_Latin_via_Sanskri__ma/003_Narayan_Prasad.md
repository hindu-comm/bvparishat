**\<\<I have been trying to learn Latin via English but it appears that learning via Sanskrit would be faster>\>**

  

In 1980's I had some introductory knowledge of Latin through English.

Major peculiarities of Latin are: (1) Like Sanskrit, you read it as you write (2) There are noटवर्ग ध्वनि in it. So, et cetera =एत् केतेरा ( and not एट् सेट्रा).
