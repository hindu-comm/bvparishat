\<*As for ṟ /r/, the Telugu equivalent (**ఱ U+0C31) when geminated has a different phonetic realization to that of Tamil. In Telugu, ఱ్ఱ ṟṟa, as expected, is realized as a geminate trill /rra/ but in Tamil ற்ற ṟṟa is uniquely realized as /tt̺ʳ̺ə*/.\>



Below is a table I prepared that shows the pronunciation of the written characters ṟ, ṟṟ and ṉṟ in Malayalam and Tamil



[TABLE]



My theory is that the ancient pronunciation of ṟṟ was ṯṯ and that of ṉṟ was ṉḏ. Most likely, ṟ was pronounced as ṯ or in other words, an ancient ṯ evolved into ṟ. The three-way differentiation of n (n, ṉ and ṇ) points to a similar three-way differentiation of t (t, ṯ and ṭ)
