Pollock: "What I offer instead as a rough-and-ready working definition at the same time embodies a kind of program, even a challenge: **philology is, or should be, the discipline of making sense of texts**. It is not the theory of language—that’s linguistics— or the theory of meaning or truth—that’s philosophy— **but the theory of textuality as well as the history of textualized meaning**. If philosophy is thought critically reflecting upon itself, as Kant put it, then philology may be seen as the critical self-reflection of language. Or to put this in a Vicunaidiom: if mathematics is the language of the book of nature, as Galileo taught, philology is the language of the book of humanity.” (p. 934 in [this](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/90c7/2a3daed999a5d0471d860cfa4eeba668448e.pdf)) \[Emphasis mine\]

  

Pollock: "...indeed, that no covering term exists in Sanskrit that even approximates “philology.”" (Pollock 2015:114) \[[*World Philology*](https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674052864)\]
