Namaste,  
  
It is for Dr. Cox and Dr. Pollock to explain their arguments in a more credible way, but if they are arguing that there were multiple Middle-Indic languages along with Old-Indic, along with a sophisticated native grammatical, phonetic and etymological tradition in the mid-1st-millenium BCE - their insistence that there was complete lack of a science of comparative philology to compare those Indo-Aryan languages defies credibility.  
  
If they on the other hand, accept my argument that there was no need for philology until much later - as there were no multiple spoken languages but only dialects of spoken Old-Indic that were anyways not very distant from one another - then (and then alone) would a lack of philology in the mid-1st millenniumBCE make sense.  
  
Certainly there was no lack of intellectual rigour in linguistics during the time of Panini, so it defies logic that they could not come up with comparative philology unless there was no need for it.

  

Regards,

Ramakrishnan
