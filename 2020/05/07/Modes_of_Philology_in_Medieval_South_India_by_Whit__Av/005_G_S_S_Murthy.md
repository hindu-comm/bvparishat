That concept of philologydoes not exist in Indian scholarship need not be an issue. There are many concepts and words which resonate in Indian ambience and which cannot be translated to non-Indian languages. The very concept of "History" seems alien to Indian ethos. I am still searching for a good original Sanskrit word to convey the concept of "symmetry".

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
