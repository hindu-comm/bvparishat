'Philology' Dr Cox talks about in this article is not comparative study of languages. He is talking about study of textual sources. This definition

suits the discussion by Dr Cox.

  

'it is the intersection oftextual criticism,literary criticism,history, andlinguistics '

  

There is a significant emphasis on textual critical aspects in the article.

  

The article is dealing with Philology in that sense.

" They lacked a word for ............................" kind of comment can be made across all cultures.

  

Most world languages lack a word for रोटी, while many Indian languages have words like rotte, bhaakree, bhakkiri.

  

Philology is one such word born as a name for an activity of a certain space and time, space is western society and time is modern period. There is a no word for philology in the period before that even in the western society. Thats how things are with regard to concepts and words for them. They are born in a space and time. Not to find equivalents of them in another space and time is natural and expected. Finding closer or equivalent concepts and words in a different space and time makes the situation interesting. But to point out absence of closer or equivalent concepts and words in a different space and time as a lacuna of that space and time, if it happens or happened, is immature and naive. But is such a pointing out happens as a neutral observation people of that space and time need not unnecessarily take offence to such observation.

To arrive at universalizing generalizations 1. through comparative studies of multiple specific cases of the phenomenon and 2. through a keen observation of a single case of the phenomenon with a genius of universalizing ability are two different possibilities.

  

Bhartrihari's universalizing observations about the phenomenonof language belong to the method #2 above. Observations of Modern General Linguistics belong to the method #1 above.

  

There are many such other examples. Vedic psychological observations belong to method #2 above. Introspective observations of one's own inner world are involved there. Psychological observations in Modern Psychology mostly belong to #1 above while there are significant number of examples for method #2 too in Modern Psychology.

  

Vedic Anthropological and Sociological observations belong to method #2 above and Modern Anthropology and Sociology follow method #1.

  

Those who understand the value of the result not the path do not point out the absence of a method as a lacuna.

Though there are similarities in the approaches of Dr Pollock and Dr Cox , Dr Cox points out how he is making a point different from the one by Prof. Pollock when he says,

  

> " Faced with this, it is best to demur fromPollock’s insistence on > the strictly courtly location of philological scholarshipin premodern > India. When he writes that “all the critical innovations in > theaestheticization of language and its philologization came from the > stimulusoffered by court patronage,” Pollock is grounded in an > extraordinary survey ofIndic literary history, as well as in a > powerful critique of the inherited thinkingabout the instrumental > relationship of culture to power.11 Nevertheless, there are strong > reasons to doubt this supposed centrality. " (Chapter 6 pg 156.)  
>   

He goes on

  

> "Pollock’s compelling effort to rethink the culture-power connection > in premodernIndia in fact inadvertently reproduces a long-standing > historiographical  
> problem, the insistent focus on the dynastic state as the unit of > historicalrelevance. This has allowed him to teach us extraordinary > things, for instance  
> about the competition between political formations that was an engine > formuch innovative literary and theoretical writing.12 But an > unintended consequenceof this way of organizing the data tends to > misrecognize those times andplaces—like the far South in the > thirteenth and fourteenth centuries—that fallbetween the cracks of > dynastically construed history. These become unstructuredterrain: the > central Kāveri plain between the Coḻa and Vijayanagara hegemonieswas > thus the scene of Hoysala, Pāṇḍya, and Khalji martial incursions,but > little else.13 The philology of this time and place suggests something > muchdifferent, above all an intellectual and concomitantly social > dynamism that ouravailable historiographic tools do little to help us > to capture. It is perhaps bystarting with what we can know about this > admittedly élite form of culture andsociality that we may prove able > to frame research questions that can prompt a different, and > fundamentally better, understanding of this past world.

Every observer understands his unknown in terms of his known. Modern western philologists try to understand premodern Indian and /or Sanskrit scholarship in terms of what they know, i.e., philology. If they say they do not have philology , not even a word for it with a downlooking attitude , it is their immaturity and naivety. If they say such things with a consciousness that they are trying to understand their unknown in terms of their known, it is healthy.
