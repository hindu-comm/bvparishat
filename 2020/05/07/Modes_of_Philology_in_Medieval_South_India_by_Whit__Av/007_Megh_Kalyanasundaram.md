Not a response or a counter-point to any note in this thread.

Adding the following to the thread for those who see the repercussions, for the Indic traditions, of the no-word-in-Sanskrit claim:

  

Cox (in p.4 of<https://www.academia.edu/33575716/Modes_of_Philology_in_Medieval_South_India?>): "But first of all, of **what do we even speak when we speak of philology**? A great many definitions have been mooted, over a period of centuries, and these have been diverse in their presumptions and sometimes contradictory in their ramifications. **I take as a starting point a recent attempt at a definition by Sheldon Pollock, who has suggested that we understand philology** **tout court** **to be “the discipline of making sense of texts,” which “is and always has been a global knowledge practice, as global as textualized language itself**.”4 Some might wish to offer a more specific definition, or to claim that philology is something that we need to keep within a tightly maintained set of historical, cultural, or linguistic parameters to have it be of any analytic use. **For my part, I find much that is commendable in this attempt to formulate such a broadly comparative, minimalist definition, one that is deliberately framed in light of the situation in we students of the non-European past now find ourselves**. **This definition, moreover, served as a guideline** for a notable effort by Pollock and a group of his collaborators **to produce a survey of the global range of past philologies**. **This pioneering effort** of juxtaposition supplies the condition of possibility for a study like the present monograph." (Emphasis mine)
