\> does the term devatha definitely means that it has some kind of form?

  

No, not necessarily. Devata of a mantra is the topic of the mantra.

  

But is talking about Devata as having some kind of form permitted within a Vedic system ?

  

-Yes, at least in Advaita system is what Dr Sivasenani Nori-ji and Sri V Subrhmanian-ji said with references.
