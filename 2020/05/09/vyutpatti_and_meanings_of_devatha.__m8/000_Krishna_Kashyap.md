Namaskar,

  

As I understand, devatha comes from div dyothane, div kreedA vichikitsayoh

which means:

devatha word sort of means: one who plays (lila)

one who likes to win

one who illuminates or is resplendent.

  

Am I right?

can some please help me find other different meanings and grammatical details.

I dont understand grammar very well. However, I will try to understand what I can.

  

does the term devatha definitely means that it has some kind of form?

  

I know mimamsakas have a different view that mantra itself is devatha and that devatha does not have form and other attributessuch as Phala pradatva etc.

Apurva gives fruits of actions/yajnas.

  

I am wondering what the Siddhanta view of Advaita is pertaining to Devatha.

  

  

Thanks.

  

Namaskar,
