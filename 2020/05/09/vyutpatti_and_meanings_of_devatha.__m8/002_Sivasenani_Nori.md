For advaitins, everything in the realm of vyavahaara is as per the Bhaatta school of Mimaamsaa. व्यवहारे भाट्टनयः, says Chitsukhaachaarya.

  

Regarding the question of whether Devas pertain to vyavahaara or paramaartha, we have Sankaracharya clearly stating in the adhyaasa bhaashya, अविद्यावद्विषयाणि प्रमाणानि शास्त्राणि च। This includes Veda.

  

That said whereas Mimamsakas do not accept moortitva of Devatas, prateekopaasanaa is acceptable to Advaitins as a practice of saadhanaa. Please see the prateekaadhikaraNam for a detailed exposition.

  

In sum, there is a wide variety of acceptable saadhanas in Advaita, depending on the saadhaka. Routes to Brahman are many.
