Thanks a lot, Sri H.N Bhat, Sri Siva Senani, Sri Subramanian, Sri Nagaraj, for a quick response.

I get a good idea now to start going deeper. Thanks.

I am addressing the topic of devatas in the 4th chapter BhagavadgitaClass today.

Perfect timing for me. I got this prior to my class!!

  

Great benefits from this group!
