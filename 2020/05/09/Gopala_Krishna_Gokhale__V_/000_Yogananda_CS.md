Namaste all,

  

Most of you are perhaps aware that May 09, 2020, is the 154th birth anniversary of Sri Gopala Krishna Gokhale. One of the nicest accounts of his life and work that I am familiar with is \`Life of G K Gokhale' by Rt.Hon'ble V. S. Srinivasa Sastry, known for his command and mastery over the English language. This was the written version of three lectures he delivered in Bangalore and Mysore under the University of Mysore's extension lecture series in 1935. I first read the book borrowing it from IISc library. Since I liked it very much I tried to own a copy but in vain. So, when at Sriranga Digital
([https://sriranga.digital](https://sriranga.digital/)),we started making ebooks, this was one of the first ones I commissioned! We made this freely available on Google Play Books platform ([Life of Gopal Krishna Gokhale by V. S. Srinivasa Sastri - Books on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gNNCDwAAQBAJ))

in Dec 2017.

  

Recently, when we routinely checked Google Analytics for various books we have on this platform, I was pleasantly startled to find that there was a sudden spike for this particular book in April 2020 - in about 20 days in this month there were more than 3500 downloads! Am wondering what could be the reason for this sudden interest in Sri Gokhale. I would urge you to download and read it, am sure you will find it rewarding.
