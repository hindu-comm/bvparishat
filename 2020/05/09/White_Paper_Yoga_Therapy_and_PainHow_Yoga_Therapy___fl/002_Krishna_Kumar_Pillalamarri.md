I thank Shri Megh Kalyanasundaram who sent us this paper on Yoga Therapy and Pain. Just to make sure I am referring to the correct paper, I am reproducing the paper's heading and authors:

  

White Paper: Yoga Therapy and Pain—HowYoga Therapy Serves in Comprehensive Integrative Pain Management, and How It Can Do More Neil Pearson, PT, MSc, C-IAYT,1 Shelly Prosko, PT, CPI, C-IAYT,2 Marlysa Sullivan, PT, C-IAYT,3 Matthew J. Taylor, PT, PhD, C-IAYT4  
  
I went through the entire paper and the bibliography. To my honest surprise, I did not find one single reference to India, or the Hindu origins of Yoga, and the Vedic origin of Pancha kosha method of treatment of human mind. Mind you, Pancha Kosha has been mentioned and extolled as a model, but a very carefully worded document avoided all Indian/Hindu context. If some one who does not know the origin of Yoga, a reading of this paper is likely to inform him that the entire concept originated and is flourishing in the US. Such blatant misuse of someone else's intellectual property! This paper is living proof of Rajiv Malhotra's coining the terms, 'Digestion' and 'U-Turn Theory'. These people are so close to the final path of U-Turn that the next step will be to sell to Indians. I am afraid Indians will lap it up just because westerners have presented what appears to be 'scientific' data. There are more than 100 references in the bibliography, but not a single mention of Yajurveda where the panchakosha model is elucidated. If Baba Ramdev were to say the same thing, there are many 'intellectuals' who will scoff at him. It is not my contention that westerners should not use Yoga, indeed Yoga can help anybody. but with the approach these authors have taken, they are consciously trying to disassociate Yoga from its roots. In my opinion this should be resisted.

  

Is there a way to present my view directly to the writers of this white paper? If someone could point me to the best way, I will gladly write to them; else would someone help me by conveying the same thing to the authors?
