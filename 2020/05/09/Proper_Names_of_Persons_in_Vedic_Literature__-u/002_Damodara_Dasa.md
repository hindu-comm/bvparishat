Exotic India are back in action but the deliveries may take much more time.  
  
I ordered about 65 books collection before lockdown. They divided into  
3 packets. First packet I received before lockdown. Second packet got  
stuck into FedEX couries and was very slowly passing from city to  
city. I received it yesterday. 3rd packet is yet to dispatch.
