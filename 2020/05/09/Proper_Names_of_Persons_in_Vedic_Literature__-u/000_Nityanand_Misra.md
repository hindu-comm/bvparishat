Namaste

  

Does anybody have a physical or digital copy of this book by Samiran Chandra Chakrabarti? If so, please contact me off the list.

  

I would have bought the book (it is available on Exotic India) had it not been for the lockdown. However, I am not sure when Exotic India delivery and courier services will resume. 

  

Thanks, Nityananda
