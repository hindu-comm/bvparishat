That is their standard their standard practice. They order 3 copies of a book from publishers. They dispatch books which they have in stock immediately. If a book is out of stock with them they first dispatch books from publishers in and around Delhi as a second batch and for publishers outside of Delhi area one will have to wait till they get the books from the publishers and dispatch. They promptly refund the money if they cannot procure a book and remove those books from their website. I called exotic Indian 10 days back and they said they are not operating as of now but will start operations soon.
