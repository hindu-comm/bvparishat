Dear Vidwans,

  

Traditional Indian philosophical texts assume that all the participants, or groups of participants accept certain beliefs as being truthful facts. However, modern-day philosophical discussions do not necessarily have the luxury of this assumption and the participants are generally aware of the findings of science and technology.

  

In this light, I have come up with a survey to capture the opinions of people who are interested in philosophy, on a variety of such beliefs, to get a sense of current state of affairs, and to spur research and further investigation in topics that are considered controversial.

  

The survey will be open till May 16th, and the data collected will be reported May 17th.

  

I request you to kindly provide your inputs at this link -> <https://forms.gle/mP8Xmj3xjvU9NPp38>

  

Note: It is an anonymous survey, but it requires you to sign in to Google to prevent duplicate entries from a single person. It does not collect your email address. Please do not enter any personally-identifiable information in the survey. All data entered in this form will be made publicly available. By responding to this survey, you agree that you are releasing your responses under public domain (CC0 license <https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/> )

  

Please feel free to forward this to anyone interested.

  

Thank you.

Regards,

Pradyumna
