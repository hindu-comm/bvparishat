Dear Radhakrishna Ji,

  

  The description of विसर्ग in all phonetic texts like the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas is that it is not only a *kaṇṭhya* sound, it is also an *aghoṣa* "voiceless" sound unlike ह which is included in the घोषवत् "voiced" consonants. What happened in the history of Indo-Aryan languages is that the visarga was completely lost in all Prakrits that were the mother-tongues of the later Sanskrit-users. However, the voiced ह survived in all the Prakrits from the ancient to modern times.
Under the influence of this situation, the pronunciation of visarga was affected and in many regions of India a word like देवै: came to be pronounced as देवैहि. This is no surprise, as the instrumental plural form reported in Prakrit and Pali exactly matches देवेहि \[Skt. ऐ \> ए, standard change in Pali and Prakrit\]. I am not familiar with Dravidian languages, and don't quite know what influence they had on the pronunciation of Sanskrit in the regions speaking Dravidian languages.
With best wishes,
