Thanks Prof. Deshpande ji, that was very informative. Pronunciation of visarga in Dravidian family languages is also like that in modern Indo Aryan.  Visarga ending "aḥ" is pronounced like "aha", ending "iḥ" is pronounced "ihi", ending "uḥ" is pronounced "uhu" and so on. Visarga in the middle of a word is treated differently. Duḥkha is pronounced dukkha, niḥśēṣa is pronounced niśśēṣa and so on. In other cases, modern Sanskrit sandhi rules are followed, as in duḥ + yōgam = duryōgam, etc.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
