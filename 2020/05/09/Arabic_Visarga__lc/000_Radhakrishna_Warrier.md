We had a discussion on Sanskrit visarga some time ago.  In that thread, I had remarked that visarga might be the remnant of some consonant that disappeared because of lenition through the ages. Let me introduce here an Arabic “visarga”.

“Madīnaḥ” in Arabic means city. Any city, not just the famous Madīnaḥ where prophet Muhammad is buried. It is written as “مدينة”. The last letter (the leftmost) is “ـة” which is actually two dots of character “ta” (ت) placed over the ending or final form of character “ha” (ه) which looks like this: ـه. This character is called “tāa marbūtaḥ” (let us call it “Arabic visarga”) and is pronounced at the end of the word like a murmured ‘h’. Sounds like how a Sanskrit visarga might have been pronounced in the distant past.

The ‘ta’ that disappeared due to the process of lenition resurfaces when another word starting with a vowel is added to the word ending in the “Arabic visarga”. The city where prophet Muhammad is buried is called Madinatul Munawwara (مدينة المنورة) which is written as Madīnaḥ al munawwara meaning the city of light or the radiant city. Here, the ‘t’ sound resurfaced because the words “al munawwara” came immediately after Madīnaḥ.

Other words ending in the “Arabic visarga” behave similarly as described in the case of Madīnaḥ.
