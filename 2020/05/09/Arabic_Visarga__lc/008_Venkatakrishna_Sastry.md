Namaste



1. On this interesting thread seeking clairty on ' ह ' and 'visarga also known as visarjaneeya) - (stand alone or at the end of a 'pada'
or ' svara-vyanjana) - ह ’ (ह्)ः - अः - इः '

and remotely connecting it to two ' ह ' and two ' अ ' s -



**The question that haunts my mind is What will be Samskruth with visarga substituted by 'ha or losong visarga ? Why are we misisng the right pointer given by Prof.Madhav Deshpande invoking Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya? What may be done to bring out the right use of Samskrutham along side regional languages ?**



2. The following expression is most common usage where one can clearly see - ह and visarga.

हरिः ओम् Would it be proper to write /pronounce this as हरिह्- ओम् :



 Another expression I would draw to limelight here is the expressions ' नमः-शिवाय ' where the modifications of ' visarga' are seen ! ( in script as well as regional pronunciation.)



3. Coming to Panini, if Panini was not clear on the visarga and ' ह ' , why would there be rules mentioning the transformations of
visarga and ' ह ' - independently ? Is there any rule in Panini which suggests visarga to get transformed to ' ह ' ?



4. In Yoga-akshara perspective of analysis, ' ह ' is a 'yogavaaha' - Vyanjana ; visarga is not. 

In Yoga-akshara perspective Visarga is ardhaakshara ( which may be constrcuted as half svara or half vyanjana !)



 Pronunication and effort evidence this. Bad pronunciation practice and scripting practice (even when widely used) does not make
substitution of visarga by 'ha' to be valid formation; at least in Samskruth.





5. An interesting point to observe on how Gunitakshara / barakhadi \<' vyanjana+svara'> was taught in scools for the past three hundred plusyears in India and how modern digital standards present the same !



Classical barakhadi usually ends with (say for example ) as कं - कः, मं-मः- हं -ह: using अं-अः This is still common for many indian languages.

In Unicode, Wiki - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_script> the anusavara- visarga combine is not listed.

In Uniocde Wiki- <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari> the visarga, ha are explained with subtle but clear difference.



About difference of visarga uccharana in Brahmi language families
(Samskruth - Prakruth ) and Arabic is like comparing apples and oranges. If Samskruth pronunciation is double layer masked by
overlay of ' Prakruth pronunciation and poor scripting', should the blame be passed on to Grammarians ?
