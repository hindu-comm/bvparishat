Could the origin of *devehi* in the Prakrts be *devebhiH* in the Vedic,

\- rather than just *devaiH* ((mis-)pronounced/approximated to *devaihi*)?

  

This prAkrtisation is already there in the Vedic:

*gRhNAmi* \< *grbhNAmi* etc.

All the *mahAprANa*-s seem to be liable to be replaced by the h-sound.
