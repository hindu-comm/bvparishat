Dear Prof. Kannan,

  

  That is clearly a possibility. However, it is my guess that the pronunciation of Sanskrit as देवैहि was facilitated by the Prakrit देवेहि, and the fact that the voiceless Visarga had completely disappeared from all Prakrits, the mother tongues of the Sanskrit speakers. But that is my bestguess. Best wishes,
