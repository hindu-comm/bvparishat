Dear Vidwans,

  

Reconstruction of voice from script is a demanding exercise even when it is scripted in Devanagari script.

  

I have been involved in an attempt to script the compositions of the tabla which are metered to a specific taal. The tabla wizard Ahmedjan Thirakwa used to make two important remarks, 1) That the compositions cannot be scripted he would say ये लिखने की चिज थोडी है। 2) He would say ये कॉलेज मे सिखनेकीं चिज थोडी है। There is a popular phrase सीना पसींना in guru shishya parampara meaning that studying an art form is a combined workout for both guru and shishya.

  

What are the problems in accurately scripting a samhita as is of the tabla ? Scripting compositions of classical hindustani music is even more demanding. Can a figure be accurately rebuilt from its caricature? This is exactly what happens when one tries to rebuild voice forms from script. The challenges multiply many fold when the scripted material is archaic.

  

There is one more challenge, i.e. reconstucting voice of an individual and that of a people, a community. There are differences in voicing from individual to individual.

  

Inspite of the existence of shiksha granthas there is a lot of difference of opinions among them to come to any general opinion on the specific nature of voicing script. Thus to conclude that x, y z people voiced words as x, y, z is too speculative.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
