\> All prakrits do not have "dukkha" because all prakrits do not in these  
\> circumstances undergo gemination of the complex cluster unlike Pali. The  
\> Ashokan epigraphic language does not do it  
  

Geminates are *never* written in the early inscriptions. So this is a mere orthographic phenomenon.

  
  
\> The -ebhiḥ ending (for -aiḥ in standard sanskrit) was exceptional, it was not the norm in Old-Indo-Aryan.  
  

Still in the *Ṛgveda* the two endings -*ebhiḥ* (543 times of 211 stems ) and -*aiḥ* (666 times of 221 stems) are almost equally frequent, but already in the *Atharveda* the ending -*ebhiḥ* decreases significantly.  
  
There is plenty that could be said about all the rest of what has been claimed here, but I simply do not have the time. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel, just study the relevant literature.  
  
  
Best,
