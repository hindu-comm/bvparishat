Dear Prof. Deshpande ji,

  
  
\>\>My reply simply is that all Prakrits and Pali have "dukkha," and even modern Marathi has "dukkha," which no Marathi speaker has any difficulty in pronouncing \<\<  
  

1. All prakrits do not have "dukkha" because all prakrits do not in these circumstances undergo geminationof the complex cluster unlike Pali. The Ashokan epigraphic language does not do it, the language underlying the north-western Kharoshthi manuscripts (so called Gandhari) doesn't do it, many other prakrit registers too dont have dukkha in place for duḥkha, so I am unable to understand what you mean by saying "all prakrits and pali have dukkha". In fact the kharosthi texts show so many irregular forms for this word (dukha; duho; duṃkha; dokha, duha, dukhu, dokhu, duhe etc) that I am very much inclined to believe these are orthographic irregularities & constraints (compounded by a evident lack of awareness of the phonemic inventory of the spoken language among the writers of these texts) rather than authentic vernacular dialectal forms.  
  
2. Pali and Marathi are not both directly derived from Old-Indo-Aryan so what is true of Marathi is not ipso facto true for the spoken language underlying canonical Pali (and vice versa), so I am unable to accept this analogy. Marathi speakers do not imagine they are speaking dukkha with a visarga, but Pali speakers would have (that is because we here are speculating how the historical spoken language underlying epigraphic Pali, written in Old-Brahmi & Kharoshthi, would have sounded keeping in mind the known limitations of those early scripts and the orthographic conventions that were in use, rather than blindly believe that the spoken language was phonetically represented accurately in writing.  
  
3. All indications are that the spoken language for which the early scripts (brahmi & kharosthi) were invented did not follow a fully scientific (or standardized) mapping of sounds to script, so the early scripts did not allow for phonetically accurate representation of the spoken language. In fact the kharosthi script in its early centuries did not even show vowel length distinctions but this is no evidence to show that the underlying spoken Indo-Aryan language in the 4th century BCE had shed its all its long vowels. It is only an evidence that the script did not allow such vowel length distinctions to be orthographically represented (until that script evolved enough over the centuries to allow fully phonetic representation of the spoken language -- and voila, you have phonetically accurate sanskrit appearing after centuries of apparent written "prakrit" -- when really all that had happened is only that the script had evolved, not so much the spoken language).  
  
4. While you reject the sound shift of pali dukkha from its immediately prior OIA form \* duḥkha, where the presence of the of the immediately prior visarga is indicated by the gemination (for lack of a better term) thus resulting in -k(\*h)kh- ; I am inclined to believe that the visarga's position in the spoken word was sought to be preserved in writing by the use of an approximating consonant that existed in the script. I am not inclined to believe that the visarga simply disappeared in speech when its position was approximated in writing by the use of a replacement consonant. The need for the gemination in Pali (not in Marathi) arises because the underlying speech in the spoken language underlying Pali orthography still had that visarga.  
  

5\. The -ebhiḥ ending (for -aiḥ in standard sanskrit) was exceptional, it was not the norm in Old-Indo-Aryan.  
  
In canonical pāli too, *the same exceptional nature of the -ebhiḥ ending was preserved faithfully* in forms such as '...suññā parappavādā samaṇebhi aññehi' (in Dīgha Nikāya -Mahāparinibbānasuttaṃ), 'sukho bhavetha, aññatra bhavantebhi'(Dīgha Nikāya -mahāgovindasuttaṃ), 'karitvā nipuṇebhi vidūhi sabbhi' ( Dīgha Nikāya - Lakkhaṇasuttaṃ), 'yaṃnūnāhaṃ dantebhi dantamādhāya' (Majjhima Nikāya -mahāsaccakasuttaṃ), 'aṭṭhi tacena onaddhaṃ, saha vatthebhi sobhati' ( Majjhima Nikāya - raṭṭhapālasuttaṃ) *however the -ebhi (\< ebhiḥ)ending is very rare*. The usual ending in Pali is -ehi(\< aiḥ). Therefore ī am unable to accept this as an argument that all OIA -bhi- became -hi- in Pāli. In fact the bh \> h is not consistent so there is no such sound shift that can be considered characteristic, across the board, of Middle-Indic (or even of Pali alone).
