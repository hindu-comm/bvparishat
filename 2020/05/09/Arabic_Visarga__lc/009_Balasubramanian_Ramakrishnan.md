As per kR^iShNa-yajurvedIya shikSha-s an exception to visarga sandhi is the chanting of hariH om at the beginning of a prashna/anuvAka.

  

Examples:

  

1\. प्रश्नानुवाकाद्यारम्भे सविसर्गोच्चरो हरिः - शंभुशिक्षा  

2\. हरिप्रणवमध्येऽपि सन्धिर्नस्यात् प्लुतेषु च - आत्रेयशिक्षा

  

So it's हरिः ॐ with an actual visarga and not हरिह् ॐ.
