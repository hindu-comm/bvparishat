Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  Thanks for your very detailed message which raises numerous concerns and I don't think I can respond to all of them, even if I knew how to. I will take just a few points.

  You say "devehi is very clearly derived from devaiḥ." In my earlier message, I was not so much talking about the derivation of "devehi," but the fact that the Visarga disappears in Prakrits and Pali, while the voiced ह survives. However, I now tend to agree with Professor Kannan's suggestion that "devehi" is derived from "devebhiḥ."
Why do I think so? Looking at the forms in Prakrits and Pali like "nadīhi," "mālāhi," "catūhi" etc., it is clear that there is no context of Skt "aiḥ," but in all these forms, the corresponding Skt forms contain "bhiḥ." So the correlation of Skt "bhiḥ" to Prakrit and Pali "hi" seems very clear to me.

  In your view, the change of Skt "ai, au" to Prakrit/Pali "e,o," is purely orthographic as the early Kharoṣṭhī/Brahmi scripts did not have a way of distinguishing "ai/e, au/o." This argument does not seem likely in my view. By all studies of the development of these scripts, these scripts were not originally designed to represent Sanskrit, but all earlier documents are only in Prakrits, and Sanskrit inscriptions appear a few centuries later. It seems logical to assume that the full range of signs in these scripts to represent Sanskrit sounds missing in Prakrits is a relatively late development, rather than the other way around.

  The last point I want to deal with is your statement that the Pali "dukkha" is simply a Pali way of representing the Sanskrit "duḥkha," because the combination "kkha" does not seem natural to you for some reason. My reply simply is that all Prakrits and Pali have "dukkha," and even modern Marathi has "dukkha," which no Marathi speaker has any difficulty in pronouncing. Clearly they are not pronouncing "duḥkha" and believing that they are saying "dukkha." The first "k" in such clusters as "kkh" is described by the Prātiśākhyas as *abhinidhāna*which is a pronunciation of a consonant without full release. In no sense is the pronunciation of "dukkha" phonetically unlikely.

  Now I have lost track of many of your informative explanations and may have to return to them at some later point. I do appreciate your probing thoughts on these issues, though I may disagree with some of them. With best regards,
