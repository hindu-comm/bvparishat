Apropos Prof.Warrier's note, "Pronunciation of visarga in Dravidian family languages is also like that in modern Indo Aryan.  Visarga ending "aḥ" is pronounced like "aha", ending "iḥ" is pronounced "ihi", ending "uḥ" is pronounced "uhu" and so on.", is it considered an aberration and therefore incorrect?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
