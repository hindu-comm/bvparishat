Namāṃsi Prof. Kannan & Prof. Deshpande,

  
  
\>\>Could the origin of devehi in the Prakrts be devebhiH in the Vedic,  
- rather than just devaiH ((mis-)pronounced/approximated to devaihi)?  
  
This prAkrtisation is already there in the Vedic:  
gRhNAmi \< grbhNAmi etc.  
All the mahAprANa-s seem to be liable to be replaced by the h-sound.  
  

Not really.  
  
1. The vedic forms of Gṛh/gṛbh have no apparent connection with the visarga getting lost in prākṛt, as the h/bh in gṛh/gṛbh is not a visarga, moreover this is a very rare occurrence in my understanding so cannot be extrapolated as a potential phonetic sound shift across the board to all similar words - or putatively attributed to ostensible prākṛtic developments already being present in the prakṛti.

  
2. The phonemic innovation in devaiḥ / \*devebhiḥ \> devehi (say in pāli) is to the final visarga not to the intervocalic \*-bh- sound. So there is no need to reconstruct a parent form that could have contained a -bh- in it to explain this change.

  

3. devehi is very clearly derived from devaiḥ. This does not mean pali had lost the ai and theḥ sounds, and they got replaced by e and hi, that would be a very wrong way to look at it. We have to really go deep into the phonetic issues at play. In Pāṇini's time the **\*āi \> ai** & **\*ai \> e** (also **\*āu \> au** & \***au \> o**)chain shiftshad not yet happened in sanskrit (which with its several dialects, was the commonly spoken bhāṣā of the day, even after being standardised by Pāṇini). Also to the redactors of the Pali canon who (living not too distant from Pāṇini in time) were very likely not schooled in phonetics or morphology, the \*āi and \*ai would have sounded too similar to need separate akṣaras in the script so both were represented by the same letter 𑀏 (brāhmī symbol for 'e'). Thus while devaiḥ was pronounced \*daivāiḥ by Pāṇini, it was pronounced in much the same way by the redactors of the pali canon, but written as devehi (where both e were expected to approximate the unified ai phoneme of the unschooled person.

  
4. As to why hi remains instead of the visarga, rather than disappearing altogether, again I disagree with Prof. Deshpande that it was 'lost' in Pali. It did exist in the pronunciation, but to the person unschooled in phonetics, the pronunciation of ḥ and hi would not have been all that different and hence did not necessitate the invention of a new akṣara in their script (that had no letter for it in the first place). The fact that it was still pronounced in speech is abundantly clear from the surviving -hi in devehi, so it was not lost, and neither was this a genuine sound-shift from ḥ to hi, if that were the case duḥkha would not have become dukkha but probably something like \*duhakha or \*duhukha in pali. If ḥ simply disappeared in speech, it would not have left a geminate -k- in its place either (as in dukkha). So both in devehi and dukkha, the visarga remains in the spoken dialect, but in written Pali the script simply tries to approximate it with the closest sounding equivalent.

  

5\. The question therefore is really about who invented the Kharosthi and brahmi scripts in the 4th century BCE, and to what extent they disagreed (knowingly or unknowingly) with the reality of the sounds in Pāṇini's pratyāhāra sūtras that their common bhāṣā contained. The 4th century BCE is when really the story of writing and of prakritic innovations resulting therefrom, both begin. I consider looking for these "prakritic" sound shifts in the Samhita and Brahmana dialects sounds to me like an anachronic wild-goose chase.  
  
6. To assume that all prakrit was really phonetically spoken exactly as they are represented in writing (just because that is the case for sanskrit) is also to me a completely misconceived notion, that simply has no conclusive evidence to back it up.  
  

7\. Therefore I am yet to get convinced that the spoken language underlying Pali (and spoken language underlying the Aśokan edicts) was phonetically or grammatically as different as the written texts (misinterpreted as depicting the spoken language with phonetic accuracy) would seem to indicate. To me Ashoka's spoken language, and the spoken language of the redactors of the pali canon, still had the visarga (although it is missing in the scripts they used).  
  
8. I can also show that ṛ was similarly existing in the spoken languages of the redactors of the pali canon, and in Ashoka's own language, but that again is another long story in phonetics, so I will describe my understanding of it later.

2. Secondly if we just focus on one documented register (say Pāli) rather than use catch-all terms like "prākṛt", it would be easier to understand what exactly is being meant. Prakrit is not one single clearly defined register but an umbrella term to denote a mass of inchoate lexical, grammatical and phonetic developments (not all of which are regional, not all of which are vernacular/dialectal and not all of which are grammatical, and not all of which are phonetic/phonemic), so to say that prakrit lost the visarga (and to then look for that already in vedic) seems a very confusing approach.  
  
3. Thirdly, I take exception to the belief that prākṛtam was a spoken dialect (or set of dialects) in the last five centuries BCE, or worse, even before that. That is not yet conclusively proved, I am yet to see even a single recorded reference from any literature from the BCE period to there being any non-sanskrit spoken language or dialect that was recognized to be "the mother tongue(s) of the sanskrit speakers".

  

4\. Fourthly, I think the idea that visarga was lost, let's say in Pali (rather than prakrit) - is a hasty and very probably incorrect conclusion. As we know Pali introduces doubled/geminate consonants where there used to be a consonant cluster in Old-Indic (but this doubling is not a feature of all prakrit, just of Pali). Pali also introduces this "gemination" (for lack of a better term, since k & kh in dukkha are not really geminates) to indicate the existence of the visarga - Sanskrit duHkha becomes dukkha. If the visarga were simply lost, it would simply have vanished and not left any trace in the resulting Pali word.  
  

5\. Now let's take the example offered by Śrī Deshpande ji, he apparently says devaiḥ simply became devehi in prakrit (assuming he is speaking about Pāli), that does not explain it.
