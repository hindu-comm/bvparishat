Dear Dr. Steiner,

  
  
\>\>Geminates are never written in the early inscriptions. So this is a mere orthographic phenomenon.\<\<  
  

Yes, but not just that, there are plenty of other such orthographic phenomena that litter the Ashokan inscriptions and other early written texts. The fact that OIA words ending in consonants routinely shed their final consonants when represented in writing in early epigraphy (and in 'written' Pali manuscripts) but preserve them within compounds, are another indication of similar orthographic phenomena in operation.

  

Regarding -ebhiḥ being almost as frequent as -aiḥ in the Ṛgveda saṃhitā dialects - this is true but holds nothing of relevance to the Pali canon whose underlying spoken language was not coeval to the language of the Ṛgveda saṃhitās nor even was derived directly from any such archaic dialect. The distribution of -ebhi and -ehi in Pāli broadly matches the frequency of -ebhiḥ and -aiḥ respectively in late-OIA (the immediately preceding or coeval OIAdialect,to the underlying spoken dialect of Canonical Pali) - so the need to seek recourse to the archaic dialects to explain the ostensible \*-ebhiḥ \> -ehi sound shift does not arise.

  
\>\>There is plenty that could be said about all the rest of what has been claimed here, but I simply do not have the time. It is not necessary to reinvent the wheel, just study the relevant literature.\<\<  

Despite all that has been said (none of which has conclusively settled the question), are you saying people like Louis Renou (and plenty of other modern scholars) were not studying the relevant literature enough when he called the absence of OIA in the early epigraphic records (and itsubiquity from the start of the CE onwards) the "great linguistic paradox of India"?
