Dear Vidwans,

  

Is the visarga a consonant sound or a vowel sound?

  

Is the visarga not included in the Maheshwar Sutra?

  

What is the difference between ह and the visarga sound both in terms of effort as well as it's sounding? If there is none can we not do away with the orthographic sign of visarga?

  

Has Panini done away with the visarga as Patanjali too includes it in the Ayogavaha letters?

  

What is the use of naming something if one does not tell what it stands for at least as 'a' as in apple?

  

Does 'a' as in apple stand for the sound or for the scripted letter 'a' in the word apple.

  

Lastly,

  

'The description of विसर्ग in all phonetic texts like the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas is that it is not only a kaṇṭhya sound, it is also an aghoṣa "voiceless" sound unlike ह which is included in the घोषवत् "voiced" consonants.'

  

Is the ह in the 5th Sutra of the Maheshwar Sutras and the ह in the14th Sutra of the Maheshwar Sutras one and the same? Are both कंठ्य sounds?  

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
