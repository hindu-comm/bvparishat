Namaste Deshpande ji



Please excuse me for pushng the same issue once again.



1. I have full respect for the great work done at Deccan College and illustrious scholars mentioned by you. That is at the high end of schoalrship, the ivory tower of research. 



2. I seek your specific views on the observations made by the author
mentioned at point 4 below : summarized by me as \< The relevance of connecting this discussion to 1954-Pune- Linguistics project (file attached) : The project, as per the author Hartmut Scharfe - observation made in the year 1977 ( 23 years after commencement of project) - ushered in a different factoring , called ' Bloomfield and
Chomskian linguistics'. According to Hartmut Scharfe, this lead to neglect of the historical -literary implications and abandoning the
indian concpets in samskruth studies. What are the shifts in understanding indian langauge-study resources due to this shift ? The partners in this study and implementation of outcome seems to have percolated deep down to the designs of language teaching at schools of india. Is there any follow up study on the outcome and impact of the project ? - is the question. \>

3. Reason for pushing the same issue for a second time is the diversity of views that have emerged on the articulation of 'Visarga' and pushing back the issue to standards by Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya.

**The ground reality stands at the schools, in langauge teaching** :

Samskruth as well as Brahmi language families teach barakhadi as a common base to learn langauges; The pronunciain of Visarga, anuswara, 'ha' - are part of this teaching.

It is a ground reality that regional language barakadi influence runs strongly on Samskruth teaching in first learnng of Samskruth.. Example: The same barakadi teaching in Karnataka , Andhra, bengal, Maharashtra,
Gujrat and Kerala- does not carry the same standard pattern. (Certainly NOT the vedic standard pattern).

**The regional langauge influence makes a clear show in conversation. So does the anglicised scripting and pronunciation, causing a deviant understanding of Paninian sutras**.

In simple words, svara-Vyanjana are non translatables; and pushng the 'vowel-Consonant model ' of european langauge brings in a differential gap in understanding ' phonation'.

The 'abhyantara and bahya-prayatna models need a different perspective to explain 'Maheswara Sutras ' from shikshaa , Pratishakhya and Yoga
perspective, as needed for Chandas and Bhashaa.

This work, if it has been done by any earlier scholar, please help me with a reference. Siddhanta Kaumudi draws reference to this, but does not offer total explanation. 

This is 'Antra-yoga' part of ' Yoga Samskrutham', where the Shikshaa sutra, anchoring ' Varna-Maalaa' to individuals consciousness and internal effort makes sense'.

This teaching model is unique to 'vedanga -Shaddanga- Vyakarana- linguistics perspective', clearly distinct from the Social language usage model linguisitcs of eurpoean langauges. 

This teaching is used in Abhinava Guptas teachings to explain practice of shiva sutras as ' Mantra -saadhanaa' ( one of the upaayas).

4. **Why and how neglecting this issue causes a problem at a later time, especially in teaching Samskruth grammar ?**



 Think of challenges in explaining the two words : सः (he) -
सह ( together) to a beginner - learner for clarity on ' ह' and
विसर्ग usage.

If the teaching in the initial stage gets bad, it will reflect later in interpreting the Paninian sutras :

आदिरन्त्येन सहेता (१-१-७१) , सह सुपा । (२-१-४)- तेन सहेति तुल्ययोगे ।(२-२-२८) विनञ्भ्यां नानाञौ नसह ।(५-२-२७)

As well as importance of explaining Paninian use of visarga to understand the sutras कुप्वोः XकXपौ च । (8-3-37) invoking technicality of 'ardha-visarga sadrushau:: half Visarga like…..
