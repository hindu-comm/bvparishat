Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

  I want to add one clarification. The info on Buddhist Sanskrit Grammarians that you have quoted relates to grammars of Sanskrit composed by Buddhist grammarians like Kumāralāta. These are not grammars of Prakrit. So the fact thatKumāralāta describes Visarga does not mean that the Visarga existed in Prakrit. We have grammars of Pali composed in the Theravada traditions in Sri Lanka and Burma, but those grammars are grammars of Pali and not Sanskrit. The Buddhist Sanskrit grammarians were all from the northern Mahayana tradition whose scriptures were in Sanskrit and obviously the Visarga did survive in Buddhist Sanskrit as it did in Sanskrit used by the Jain and the HIndu traditions. But the written representation of Visarga by all these traditions gives no indication of the changing pronunciation of the Visarga.

  Your quoted page about the beginning of the teaching of modern linguistics in Pune in 1954 is informative, but I am not sure what it has to do with the discussion on the pronunciation of the Visarga. I must be missing something.

  With best regards,
