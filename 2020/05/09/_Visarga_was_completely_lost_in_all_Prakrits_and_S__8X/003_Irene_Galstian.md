I wasn't sure on which thread to post my question, but this one seems closer in spirit.

Could someone please help me locate what exactly what stated and in which book about how visarga should be pronounced? I'm interested in this from kriya yoga standpoint and would be grateful for the references, since I'd need to find them and study the exact wording of these instructions.

  

Thank you,

Irene
