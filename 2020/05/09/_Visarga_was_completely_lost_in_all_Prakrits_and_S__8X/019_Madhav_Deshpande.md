Dear BVK Sastry Ji,

  

I think this discussion is now going completely off-track. I do not agree with Professor Sharfe's opinion, given my personal life experience of studying in Pune with so many eminent scholars. I have described the many institutions in Pune involved in the study and teaching of Sanskrit, and these have nothing to do with the department of linguistics at Deccan College. Harping on "neglecting of Sanskrit studies," or not being familiarwith traditional ways of teaching Sanskrit in Pune simply does not match the facts on the ground. I will not continue this outstretched discussion any further. There are members like Professor Saroja Bhate, an eminent senior grammarian from Pune and Professor Ashok Aklujkar who has spent a lifetime studying the Vākyapadīya, and it is frankly insulting to suggest that the Pune Sanskrists have been led astray by the opening of the department of linguistics at the Deccan College. I know you don't mean to insult anyone, but the points being repeatedly raised are going in that direction. The department of linguistics at the DC itself hardly did any work on Sanskrit, their main focus being on other Indian languages and modern linguistics. Again, with best regards,
