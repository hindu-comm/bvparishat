Dear Paturiji,

  

Thanks a lot foryour reply.

  

The technique of determining whether a consonant sound is ghosha or aghosha by keeping once finger on the voice box or Adam's apple and feeling the vibrations in the voice box or by closing one's ears and voicing the letters and feeling the vibrations in the voice box was quite enlightening.

  

However this is what I experienced.

  

While voicing the letters in the order of the Devanagari script letters viz., क, ख, ग, घ, ङ the first two viz., could be identified as aghosha and the next three ghosha. However this difference could not be experienced while reciting the Maheshwar Sutras. All the हल् letters could be felt in the voice box and therefore all हल् letters are ghosha by Maheshwar Sutra standards.

  

This experience leads one to believe that the Devanagari script letter sequence was used to instruct letters during the evolution of the pratishakhyas and shikshas and not the Maheshwar Sutras.

  

Further this difference also shows that voicing or recitation of the Vedas did undergo change as scripting evolved. In this context Patanjali's remark that the Maheshwar Sutras are important so that
students pick up the correct pronunciation of the letters is significant.

  

I am very much grateful to all those who have participated in this thread to make me understand the sense carried by the words ghosha and aghosha. It has helped me to enhance my commitment to the Mahesh war Sutras as an instrument of instruction more than ever before.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
