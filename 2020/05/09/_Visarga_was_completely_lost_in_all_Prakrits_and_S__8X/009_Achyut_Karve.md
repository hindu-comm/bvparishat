Dear Vidwans,

  

The ह in हयवरट् in the Mahesh war Sutras is a consonant as it can be suffixed and prefixed to any of the अच् vowels. This ह is alveolar.



 'In Yoga-akshara perspective Visarga is ardhaakshara ( which may be constrcuted as half svara or half vyanjana !)' - BVK Sastry.  

  

In contrast the the ह in हल् is not a consonant as it cannot be suffixed or prefixed with any of the अच् vowels. This ह in the Maheshwar Sutras is कंठ्य.

  

According to Patanjali Sutras are to be considered Vedas.

  

The barakhadi sutras for हण् letters of Maheshwar Sutras can be compiled as

  

रलहयवत्

रिलिहिवित्

रुलुहुयुत्

रीलीहीवीत्

रूलूहूयूत्

रेलेहेयेवेत् and so on

  

However for the शल् letters the barakhadi can be compiled as

  

सःशषत्

सिःशिषित्

सुःशुषुत्

सीःशीषीत्

सूःशूषूत्

सेःशेषेत्। and so on

  

Note that in the above sutras the visarga (ह in हल्) does not become दीर्घ when recited with दीर्घ swara of सश and ष. This proves the point raised by Sastryji that the visarga can be called ardha akshara or either as ardhaswara or ardha vyanjana. It can neither be suffixed or prefixed with an अच् vowel to be called a consonant nor can it be prefixed or suffixed to a consonant to be called a swara. It is therefore a stand alone letter coming at the end of a pada.

  

This in my view is how shiksha needs to be re-thought for Sanskrit studies both in schools as well as in pathshalas.

  

With regards,

Achyut Karve.
