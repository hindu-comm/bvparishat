Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  However, please note that according to all Prātiśākhyas and Śikṣās, including the Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya, while the Visarga is abhoṣa "voiceless", the pronunciation of ह is ghoṣavat "voiced." Even though the Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya describes the Visarga as पूर्वान्तसस्थानो विसर्जनीयः 2.48, it still remains aghoṣa. The Taittirīya-Prātiśākhya 1.12 (ऊष्मविसर्जनीयप्रथमद्वितीया अघोषा:) clearly says that the Visarjanīya is aghoṣa, while the very next sūtra says that ह is not (न हकार:), with the commentary explaining: न भवति अघोषसंज्ञो हकार:. It is the aghoṣa pronunciation of the Visarga that has not survived. Best regards,
