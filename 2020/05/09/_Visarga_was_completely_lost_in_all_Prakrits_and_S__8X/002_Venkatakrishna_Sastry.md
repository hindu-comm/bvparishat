Namaste



1. I agree with your observations and clariifcation. Thanks.



2. I was intending to connect and highlight this post as a
continuation of previous thread on ' Visarga' in non Paninian/ non-vedic language context.



 The scripting convention of visarga as two ' bindu's- in the reference text for Buddhist grammar was interesting, as it comes from a land beyond India and a different langauge-eco system.



 The articulation value associated with a visual script symbol, as a oral tradiiton has undergone tremendous change and distortion, to say the least.

The standard of pronunciation is now one of personal preference and liking. There is a need to rethink on what constitutes a ' Shuddha Uccharana' !

It is not enough to pass on the baton to 'Vedic scholar and
gurukul-institution'.



 What we see in shikshaa- grammar texts is a semi-physiological description of the phonation process. 

Everything told in Samskruth tradition is not mapped to or investigated in modern linguistic studies- either in social or scientiifc models. 

I am limiting my observation in this thread to basics of teaching language basics in early schooling. ( I prefer to keep out
Science part of Speech-analytics in Samskrutham).



 The marker for ' Visarga' in non Paninian/ non-vedic language
context is to distinguisn ' visarga' in Samskrutham vis-à-vis
'Visarga' in other Brahmi, brahmi -derived/ linked/ influenced languages.



3. May be other way of articulating the question is :



 What might have been the design intention, utility, and role
of indian system of teaching anuswara and visarga as a part of
barakadi / gunitakshara - scripting and articulation in all brahmi 

languages , as a part of language learning in early formal schooling ?



 Was it mistaken introduction or intentional design to align rest of indian languages to Samskruth model OR teach something which is just redundant and useless in later languge- literature studies ?



3. The grammars of Tamil, at least, don’t seem to list visarga even though they have a partial adoption of Samskruth model. (from early times to at least till 14th century).



 About the equivalence mapping of visarga' in Samskruth to the IPA - Roman alphabet set/ Arabic, more studies may be needed.

This stduy needs to cover what happens when the visarga is unified with vyanjana -equivalent units.



4. The relevance of connecting this discussion to 1954-Pune- Linguistics project (file attached) : The project, as per the author Hartmut Scharfe - observation made in the year 1977 ( 23 years after commencement of project) - ushered in a different factoring , called ' Bloomfield and Chomskian linguistics'. According to Hartmut Scharfe, this lead to neglect of the historical -literary implications and abandoning the indian concpets in samskruth studies. What are the shifts in understanding indian langauge-study resources due to this shift ? The partners in this study and implementation of outcome seems to have percolated deep down to the designs of language teaching at schools of india.



Is there any follow up study on the outcome and impact of the project ? - is the question.
