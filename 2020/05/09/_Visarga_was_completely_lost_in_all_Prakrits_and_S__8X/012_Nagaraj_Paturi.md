Sri Achyut-ji,

  

Do you want to know which of the consonants in the Sanskrit varnamaalaare considered voiced which voiceless ?

  

In each of the five vargas कवर्ग = क , ख, ग, घ, ङ चवर्ग , टवर्ग , तवर्ग , पवर्ग

  

first क, च, ट, त, प are voiceless and the third ग, ज, ड, द, ब are voiced.

  

test ? If you touch the throat (bend of front neck connecting neck to chin) while pronouncing the voiced , you experience vibration which you don't experience while pronouncing voiceless.

  

If you closeyour ears and hear your own pronunciation of the voiced , you feel the resonance/ vibration that you don't experience while you hear your own pronunciation of the voiceless. The feel for the voiceless resembles the sound on the central part of the tabla or duggi, the one for the voiced resembles the sound on the loose part towards the rim.
