Dear Prof. Deshpande

  

Here's my take, as a researcher in the prAtishAkhya-s and the shikShA-s, as well as a keen practitioner and teacher of the tattirIya shAkhA. You have pointed out the madhye hakAraH (TP 2.6) in one of your other emails. Apart from that the same text continues, nAdo.anupradAnaM svara-ghoShavatsu (2.8), hakAro ha-caturtheShu (2.9) and aghoSheShu shvAsaH (2.10). bhUyAnprathamebhyo.anyeShu. So the TP shows that there is a gradation in shvAsa, hakAra and nAda.

  

When I say hariH it is quite different from harihi, though the latter mistake is made by many novices. Since the visarga happens at the end of a sentence (except before the conjunct kSh), there is an elongation after the breath sound (h) and that is indeed a vowel sound. Pronunciation at the end of a sentence is a little varied and traditional Vedic reciters have a particular way of elongating the final vowels/consonants, which are not covered by shikShA-s as far as I know. So to the people untrained in rigorous Vedic recitation, hariH Om may sound like harihi Om, while I can clearly hear and feel the difference. The difference of the visarga not being voiced is especially palpable to me if the preceding vowels are anything other than a/A, since the breath in the visarga takesplace at a point other than the throat. Theha- or breathy sound can come with nAda (caturtheShu) or without nAda (dvitIyeShu) - actually technically only anupradAnam or greaterproportion as I understand the sUtra-s.So there is already an example of breathysound (h) without voicing in the second sparsha-s. Such is indeed the case with visarga and I can feel it. May be I ammaking a tempest in a teapot with the minutiae, or perhaps I am imagining too much - always a possibility, but I know what I can feel is happening. I do wonder if there are any actual palatograms of trained Vedic reciters with regard to the visarga. Allen in his phonetics book points out that Whitney was mocking traditional theories about the sibilants, while much later palatograms showed the traditional phoneticians had it right. Of course the palatograms have to be of extremely trained Vedic reciters and even among those there is some gradation. My current teacher, a kramAntasvAdhyAyI trained in the kumbhakoNampAthashAlAof the Kanchi Matha, told me once about his late teacher "avar sonna vera maadiriirukkum aNNA" - "If he recites it would sound different". Thedifferencebeing that at least in the olden days the teachers would not "sully" their learning by reciting or participating in rituals except on rare occasions. That would preserve the purity of the Vedic sound. Since theshikSA-shave a specific purpose - that of Vedic recitation - it makes sense only to look at trained Vedic reciters. When Sanskrit was a more widely spoken language, it's unlikely that everyone had the "BBC accent".The minutiae were likely observed in the Vedic setting. And that can be obtainedonly by going to the right sources.
