Dear BVK Sastry,

  

  Being born and educated in Pune in its various institutions, I can say that the establishment of the Dept of Linguistics at the Deccan College had no negative impact on the study of Sanskrit and Sanskrit grammar in DC and Pune at large. The DC itself had a separate dept of Sanskrit and Sanskrit Dictionary. Prof. Katre who directed the DC himself published many volumes on Pāṇini, and the publications of the DC include dozens of Kośas, editions and translations of the Vākyapadīya, Prauḍhamanoramā with two commentaries, and much more. The University of Pune had a separate dept of Sanskrit and the Centre for Advanced Study in Sanskrit, where Prof. S.D. Joshi published more than a dozen Āhnikas of the Mahābhāṣya with TR, worked all his life on the TR of the Aṣṭādhyāyī. His colleagues at the CASS included grammarians like Professor Palsule and Devasthali, who published many works on Sanskrit grammar. It was the Bhandarkar Institute in Pune that published the Mahābhāṣya Dīpikā of Bhartr̥hari, its texts and translations. And the monumental work on the Critical Edition of the Mahābhārata that took 40+ years. At the Tilak Maharashtra Vidyapith, great scholars like Pt. Vaman Shastri Bhagavat not only taught Pāṇini, he left behind a 1500 hours of recordings of his teaching Pāṇini.

  I am writing all this, which is familiar to most Sanskrit scholars, not to leave an impression that the opening of the dept of Linguistics at the DC had some negative impact on the study of Sanskrit and Sanskrit grammar in Pune.

  With best regards,
