Irene-ji

  

There are different valid traditions on how to pronounce the visarga. The most prominent is the one supported by the taittirIya prAtishAkhya, followed by Tamil, Andhra and Karnataka paNDita-s:

  

1\. कण्ठस्थानौ हकारविसर्जनीयौ 2.46

2\. उदयस्वरादिसस्थानो हकार एकेषाम् 2.47

3\. पूर्वान्तसस्थानो विसर्जनीयः 2.48

  

The sUtras to be noted are the first and third. So hariH would be something like harihi, but not exactly. The subtleties are to be learned only guru-mukha, from at least a kramAnta-svAdhyAyin and no amount of book analysis can get the correct information.
