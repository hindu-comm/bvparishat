Dear Irene,

  

  The main texts that discuss the process of pronunciation in detail are the Prātiśākhyas, including the R̥gveda-Prātiśākhya, Śukla-Yajurveda-Prātiśākhya (=Vāsajaneyi-Prātiśākhya), Taittirīya Prātiśākhya, Śaunakīya Caturādhyāyika and the R̥ktantra. General scholarly opinion is that all available Śikṣās are later than the Prātiśākhyas. A summary description of the phonetics discussed in these texts can be found conveniently in W.S. Allen's book *Phonetics in Ancient India*.
