Thanks, Nagaraj Ji, for providing a simple explanation of अघोष and घोष. According to the Prātiśākhyas, the description is at two levels, one appears to be the articulatory process and the other the auditory effect. When the vocal chords close up, the air passing through them causes vibration (*nāda*), while if they are open, the air passes without causing a vibration, and this is called breath (*śvāsa*). In the pronunciation of h (not Visarga), some Prātiśākhyas describe that the vocal chords are partially closed (*madhye hakāraḥ*), and so it produces something described in modern articulatory phonetics as "breathy voice." Further, these distinctions produce different auditory effects. We are told that nāda or vibration produces vowels and voiced consonants (*nādaḥ svara-ghoṣavatsu*), while breath without vibration leads to voiceless consonants (*śvāso'ghoṣeṣu*). In the terminologyof the Siddhānta-Kaumudī, these features (*śvāsa, nāda, ghoṣa, aghoṣa*) are called *bāhya-prayatna*in the sense that their origin lies in the positioning of the vocal chords, and they are seen as being outside the mouth. Positioning of the points of articulation and the articulators (*sthāna, prayatna*) are seen as *ābhyantara-prayatna.* However, this distinction is not known to the earlier texts, and the description in the earlier texts is far more elaborate. With best regards,
