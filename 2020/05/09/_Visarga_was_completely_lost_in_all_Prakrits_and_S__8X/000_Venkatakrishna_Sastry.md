Namaste



I am starting this new thread in connection with the observations made by Prof. Deshpande, in the specific context of ' Visarga was completely lost in all Prakrits'.



**I am anchoring the post to two references**:

 a) Grammatical Literature- Hartmut Scharfe

 Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 1977 - India - 139 pages


<https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2_VbnWkZ-SYC&lpg=PA67&pg=PA196#v=onepage&q&f=false>



 b) A project of post independence - Indian on languages supported by American foundation at Deccan College.


<https://www.dcpune.ac.in/pdf/215-240%20Deccan-NAAC-Dept.%20of%20Linguistics.pdf> - Specific focus on Page 216- Section-C. Thrust development research areas.



**The question**: Are there any studies on the impact of the following project on Classical Samskruth teaching by standards of Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya ?



**Basis resource refeence for the question**: The quote drawn from page 199 of the resoruce (a) metnioned above.

The author, further makes a pertinent obseration in a different context, which holds good even for today. the observation on page 193
reads:



![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/2094424a3f3e5/image003.png?part=0.3)



**Section (Extract) **: The connection of this research connects to Turkestan ( and convention of writing Visarga).

![](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/2094424a3f3e5/image001.png?part=0.1)







**Request **: Samskruth Varnamaalaa pronunciation unless anchored to Maheswara sutras and norms of Shikhsaa Shastra will fall awfully short of Paninian Standards and fail the expectation of 'Vedanga-Vyakarana'
needed for Vedic studies, practicals and research. Placing 'Vedas' in any other alien frame is like 'studying fish like a bird'.



Look forward for help in understanding the issues invovled in teaching ' Samskruth Pronunciation' by Shikshaa and Pratishaakhya standards .



The deeper implications are on current methods implemented and incoprporated in Sanskrit teacher training systems, conversation, scripting and transliteration.



Regards

BVK Sastry

Dear Radhakrishna Ji,



  The description of विसर्ग in all phonetic texts like the Śikṣās and the Prātiśākhyas is that it is not only a *kaṇṭhya* sound, it is also an *aghoṣa* "voiceless" sound unlike ह which is included in the घोषवत् "voiced" consonants. What happened in the history of Indo-Aryan languages is that the visarga was completely lost in all Prakrits that were the mother-tongues of the later Sanskrit-users. However, the voiced ह survived in all the Prakrits from the ancient to modern times.
Under the influence of this situation, the pronunciation of visarga was affected and in many regions of India a word like देवै: came to be pronounced as देवैहि. This is no surprise, as the instrumental plural form reported in Prakrit and Pali exactly matches देवेहि \[Skt. ऐ \> ए, standard change in Pali and Prakrit\]. I am not familiar with Dravidian languages, and don't quite know what influence they had on the pronunciation of Sanskrit in the regions speaking Dravidian languages.
With best wishes,
