Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  Somehow, I hit the "send" button before finishing what I wanted to say. Just one point. Just as there was a Linguistic Survey of India under the editorship of Grierson more than a hundred years ago, I wish there could be a Linguistic Survey of Sanskrit Traditions, including Vedic Recitation, across India. My hearsay understanding is that there was a more recent government sponsored linguistic survey of India, but for some political reasons, it was shut down. But such wide ranging surveys are necessary to have an objective understanding of the variation in Sanskrit pronunciation and usage in various regions of India. Otherwise, our focus tends to be mostly textual and normative.
Anyway, these are just my hopes for the future studies. With best regards,
