Dear Shri Ramakrishnan,

  

  I very much appreciate your post. We have now Vedic recordings being made available through multiple sources, but there are hardly any analytical studies of these recitations, beyond the early efforts by Staal and Howard. When I was teaching at the University of Michigan at the Department of Linguistics (1972-1985), the department had a phonetics lab equipped with machines for palatograms etc. Though I was never trained to use it, my two senior colleagues, namely Professor John Catford and Professor Kenneth Pike, were world renowned phoneticians, and on one occasion, Professor Catford recorded my Sanskrit pronunciation, including the first hymn of the R̥gveda, and used these recordings for his phonetics classes. It has been too many years since then, and I have no idea as to what is happening to the phonetics lab atthe moment. I am no longer physically in the same town any longer.
In any case, it would be a great contribution to Sanskrit studies, if an institution like the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan would undertake a project in collaboration with departments of linguistics in India to analytically study the pronunciation of Sanskrit and Vedic reciters in the various regions of India. I have seen some studies like this for modern languages, but I have not seen any for Sanskrit. With best regards,
