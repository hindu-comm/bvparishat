In Tamil Smarta custom, the brahmachari, if he is required to do the shraaddha, he does that just without the 'aupasana prayaschitta homa'.
All other things are there including pinda pradana.

I think there should be no exception for a brahmachari in gurukula in these cases.He must go and after performance of all the rituals can return to the gurukula and pursue the studies. He will have the necessary period of defilement due to death of parent.
