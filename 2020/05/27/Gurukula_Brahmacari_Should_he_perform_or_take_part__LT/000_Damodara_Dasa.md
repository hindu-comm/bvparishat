Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
  
I would like to know if a grown up gurukula brahmacari should take  
part in Sraddha Ceremony and pinda dana. This case arises when his  
father is no more and he is the eldest son.  
  
This also brings us to the question about what should a gurukula  
brahmacari do in case his father dies. Should he attend and take part  
in antyeshti samskara, being the eldest (or only) son?  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
