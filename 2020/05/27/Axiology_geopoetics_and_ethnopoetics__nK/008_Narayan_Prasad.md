Sir, thank you for your reply.

  

I wanted to translate a few works of some Ural writer from Russia. In this regard I selected Mamin-Sibiryak (1852-1912), who is supposed to be the pioneer in Ural literature.  
  
I was reading Prof.O.V. Zyryanov's paper (in Russian) "Mamin-Sibiryak Literary Legacy and Prospects of Regional Literary Studies" (2012) whose Abstract is as follows:  
'\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
Abstract: The article observes the key areas of the research of Mamin Sibiryak’s body of literary works, i.e. literary method and axiology, geopoetics, genre system and the language skill of the outstanding Ural writer. The objects of the contemporary Mamin-Sibiryak studies are linked to the prospects of Ural Region literary studies.  
  
Keywords: D.N. Mamin-Sibiryak, axiological system, literary method, regional literary studies.  

'\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

  

In some other paper related to this author I also came across the term ethnopoetics.

  

I was not aware of these three terms.
