Dear Scholars,  

    Namaste.

    Recently I have come across frequent use of the terms "axiology, geopoetics and ethnopoetics" in a few Russian articles on literature. These terms are rather new to me.

    Could you suggest some introductory article or book for me elucidating these terms?

    Thanks and regards

    Narayan Prasad
