I have a book on Ethnopetics by an Israeli professor.

  

I could not find it on the web.

  

I will try to share the acan, in the forum or individually to you depending on the status of copyright.

  

Basically, it contains terms drawn from literarycriticism and some from folk literary studies part of folkloristics proposing them to be universally applicable categories to all the world literatures, oral and written, folk, tribal and classical, premodern and modern, elite and non-elite.

  

The idea seems to be a kind of socio-poetics or cultural poetics applicable to literature in general.
