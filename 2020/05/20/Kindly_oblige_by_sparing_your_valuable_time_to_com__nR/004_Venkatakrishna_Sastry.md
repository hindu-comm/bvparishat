Namaste



On Revised ediiton of document: Some more submisisons: 

1. (SB- Revised): **Note, प्रत्याहारः is not a पाणिनीया संज्ञा, not a संज्ञा coined by पाणिनि.**

** When studying अष्टाध्यायी and commentaries on अष्टाध्यायी, it would help to be clear about which one is a पाणिनीया संज्ञा and which one is coined by later commentators.**





BVK Sastry( 21 May 2020): 'Pratyahara' is a technical samjnaa, drawn in to Panini grammar commentary by later grammarians ( starting from Patanjali -?) to provide a pointer to Vak-Yoga perspective of studying Samskrutham. Pratyahara is a Yogaanga. So is Vyakarana a 'Vedanga / Vak-yoga- anga'. Vak-Yoga sampradaya of studying Panini is the origin for getting to the technical term' pratyaahaara' by later commentators. How to use this for langauge in general is explained . The upaasanaa/ Practice application is taught only through initiation. Therefor Pratyaahra is a Vak-yoga- sampradaya- Munitraya approved Samjnaa.



**The langauge addresed by Panini is given several nomenclatures and classifications, depending upon the need. **

**The names are NOT synonyms and replaceable or Translatable or even substitutable. **

**What it means is that there are multiple perspectives to understand- learn-use - benefit ' from the study of langauge: Samskrutham'.**

**Each name is provider of a Yoga-Perspective of Analysis- Visioning Langauge.**

**Historically we seem to have lost many of these 'Tradiitonal and Yoga' perspectives of 'Samskruth -Langauge-Study'.**

**Historically, Post Colonial period, the major lens being used to study Sanskrit as a language is 'HISTORICAL SOCIAL LANGUAGE PERSPECTIVE'. All other views are trashed! **

****

**Out of many names for Langauge addressed by Paninian Sutras is ,
'Vak-Yoga' . This is the Vedic name forSamskrutham. Amarakosha does not list this word-entry.**

**The 'later grammarians' refer to thes 'Vak-Yoga' tradition in a remote way. **

**This traidition is locked in technicalities of Yoga-Upanishads ; and 'Aagama- Tantras' contains secret- instructions of Vedanga Vyakarana, for Veda-Saadhanaa/ Ishwara Pranidhana/ Swadhyaya/ Mantra-yoga'. This is part of ' Muni-Traya' tradition ( Muni is a Moksha-parayana, a technical definiiton from Gita: 5-28: yatendriya-mano-buddhir , munir moksha-parayanah,
vigateccha-bhaya-krodho yah sada mukta eva sah.). What is being debated as ' Tamils' is technically a 'Siddha bhashaa / Guhya- bhashaa/ encrypted Samskruth useful for Siddhas. Post this phase, the same set of instructions need a decoding using the techniclaity of Sthita-prajna bhashaa, Samaadhi-bhashaa ( Gita:2-54: स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य केशव। स्थितधीः किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम्।।2.54।।
The term ' muni' also comes in second chapter of Gita 2-69. )**

2. (SB- Revised): **This etymological detail of the word शब्दः underscores the need to understand संज्ञा-s in अष्टाध्यायी from their etymological aspect. Actually study of Vedas can be a complete study only when they are studied by all six aspects षडङ्गाभ्यासः, शिक्षा phonetics निरुक्त etymology छन्द prosody ज्योतिष् auspicious time कल्प ritual व्याकरणम् grammar. Another view of षडङ्गाभ्यासः is study of संहिता the text, पद the words, क्रम syntax, निरुक्त etymology, छन्द phonetics and phonology and व्याकरणम् grammar. The study can and should go further to delve deeper into भावार्थः, which are sort of summarized in the उपनिषदः. So, study of Vedas should also include study of उपनिषदः i.e. of भावार्थः. This logic applies to the study of any Sanskrit text.**





BVK Sastry( 21 May 2020): Thanks for endorsing the need to get back to 'Shadanga Vedanga ' model of studying Samskrutham.

The process of getting to the meaning of the samskruth term is called ' NIRUKTI/ ARTHA NIRVACHNA'. The final meaning so derived is called 'YOGAARTHA'.


The final application for ' upa-yoga' is called ' VINIYOGA'. Dr. Yadu has introduced this concpet in many earlier posts and I have added my part of notes on this.

I hope this helps
