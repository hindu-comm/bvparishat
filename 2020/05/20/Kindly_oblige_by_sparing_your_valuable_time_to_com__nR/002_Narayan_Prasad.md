Namaste.

  

Panini has also used the terms संज्ञायाम् and शब्दसंज्ञा. These terms should also be explained. On the former Dr G.B. Palsule has written a long article. The latter was not clear to me in the initial phase from the Hindi commentary and could fully understand only from some English commentary.

Narayan Prasad
