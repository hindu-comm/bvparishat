Namaste Abhyankar ji



Thanks for sharing an excellent resoruce on the topic अष्टाध्याय्यां संज्ञाः.



Here below are my submissions on the document. ( I wont call this as comment or criticism; This is more sharing of thought-perspective . May be it is the way I was groomed in to the Samskruth texts). This study
takes significance because the term ' संज्ञाःoccurs 76 times in the main sutras in different contexts, communication and process significnaces. Not every instance is Panini created, not every instance is limited to
vyakarana, not every instance is fully commented for its 'shadnaga' significance by the later grammarians ( and much less by colonial linguists). The loss of techniclaity of a term in a discipline lends to a total misunderstanding and bad construction of traiditon provided by Panini-Patanjali-Yaska as ' Vag-yoga: Samskrutham'.

1. (SB) One does not find in अष्टाध्यायी, classification of सूत्राणि, the way they are classified by later grammarians in six types - १ संज्ञासूत्राणि २ परिभाषासूत्राणि ३ अधिकारसूत्राणि ४ विधिसूत्राणि ५ नियमसूत्राणि ६ अतिदेशसूत्राणिIt is contended that संज्ञासूत्राणि are 91 out of total 3983 सूत्राणि.



***BVK Sastry***: Paninian text is not a text in isolation. ‘Panini- Samjnas’ need to be reorganized by inheritance from poorvacharyas, by cross discipline lending from Shikshaa and Nirukta, and Panini created as Vedanga Vyakarana specifics. Later grammarians presume that this understanding comes as pre-qualification studies. The clarity is provided by ashtadhyayi commentaries as and where needed to the extent needed.

This triggers a need to study ‘Panini’ in the ‘Shadanga-Vedanga’ framework, which is the core thinking of tradition, as ‘Vak-Yoga’. This perspective of study seems to have underground in Bharath itself by 17^(th) century, by the time of onset of colonial perspective of vedic studies. What was sacred was made profane and sacrilege by breaking the integrity of living tradition. Evidence stands out in the interpretation of Sayana Madhava by Max muller. The vedic word (vaidika pada) gets interpreted in a shifted frame work. This is not about whom to put on cross for this. The focus is to be recovering the ‘ Shadanga Vedanga sampradya backdrop of Veda and Vednaga studies. This backdrop could help to figure out and organize ‘ Panini- Samjnas’ – by inheritance, by cross discipline lending and Panini created; and clean up Panini studies.

Panini text is a continuum of associated vyakarana sampradaya of Poorvacharyas, covering ‘Chandas’ and ‘Bhashaa’. The Samjnas come as an inheritance in the discipline. The new ones created by Panini are specific to Panini.

Panini text is integral with rest of the vedangas: specifically Shikhsaa and Nirukta. Therefore the Samjnas in Panini come as an cross-discipline inheritance.

Later grammarians seem to keep the ‘Teaching tradition of Ashtaadhyayi’ and keep limited observations in commentary on ‘Shadanga- related explanation’ .

2. (SB) सुप्तिङन्तं पदम् (१-४-१४) defines that whatever has सुप् or तिङ् at its ending is a पदम्.



***BVK Sastry***: Can we say: Any word that is marked as ‘ Samskruth Word ( vaidika- laukika) ’ needs to be an output of a ( alaukika- laukika/ apaurusheya- paurusheya Vyakarana process : pratyaya- yoga –prakriyayaa nishpannam padam) ; and so explainable . The corollary would be: Failure to get this compliance fails the test of a given word getting the title :’Samskrutham Padam’. This seems to me to be the technicality of ‘ roopa-Vyutpatti; shabda- nirvachana’.

The concept of ‘ Samjnaa- pramaana’ in तदशिष्यं संज्ञाप्रमाणत्वात् । (1-2-53) may need a special deliberation in this context.

‘Samjnaa – pramanatva ’ as the meaning of the base unit(prakruti – artha samketa/ samjnaa, as given ) needs to be distinguished from the technicality of ‘technical convention and process designator ‘(paaribhaashia samjnaa). I Request your help to understand this better.

3. (SB) संज्ञा gives a clear and comprehensive understanding. Donald Trump is संज्ञा of Donald Trump, because it gives a clear and comprehensive understanding of the person Donald Trump.



***BVK Sastry***: Would it be better to say ' Donal Trump' is a 'samketa' , a pointer to the designated, than the technical 'samjnaa'., like ' President' which applies to any one who ocupies a post through a process'?



येन उच्चारितेन ककुद-खुर -विषाणिनां संप्रत्ययो भवति - स शब्दः This is all inclusive definition. गौः गोणी गोता .. would be user preference to deviate from standard form, for a practical convenience, ease of usage. It could be a ' abhidhaana, naama-karana' to identify a thing, a person, a process, a class uniquely.



पद-प्रक्रिया नाम प्रकृति शब्दानां प्रत्यय संस्कारेण पदत्वापादनम् . This is process focused output.



शब्दानुशासनम् इति सुप्-तिङ्-युक्तानां , सुप्-तिङ्-आदि- प्रत्यय -प्रक्रिया द्वारा निष्पन्नानां , विभक्ति-कारकाऽन्वय-समनन्वय योग्यानां ,पदरूपतया परिणामं प्राप्तवतां संस्कृत-वाक्ये प्रयोगार्हाणां , पदानां निर्माणाय नियमानुशासनम् । This is total picture of what a 'word : पद in वाक्य would be. सुप्-तिङन्त-चयो वाक्यम्, क्रिया वा कारकान्विता ; इहान्वयमुखेनैव सर्वं व्याख्यायते मया - techniclity.
