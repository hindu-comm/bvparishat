If you google for Samaja vara gamana now, you will be taken to a Telugu film song, not the Tyagaraja Swamy lyric:

you will get the refrain from 1:15 onwards.

  

It is addressed to a woman.

  

For the audience who enjoy only the s'abdasoundaryawithout minding the meaning and its suitability, it may be just a melodious word composition.

  

But for those who know the meaning , using it for a woman sounds weird.

  

Or should we take it as part of masculinization of women that is happeningin the name of progress ?
