Namaste Dr.Kannan,

  

There is a famous Malayalam movie song from the 90s that goes

"सामजसञ्चारिणि ! सरसीरुहमधुवादिनि !

"शृणु मम हृदयंस्मरशरनिलयं,

शृणु मम हृदयंस्मरशरनिलयम् .."  

  

This song was written by acclaimed poet[Yusafali Kechery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yusufali_Kechery). In an[interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrzvUIEvK54), (from 16:41 to 18:47) he recounts an incident (afterhe wrote this song), when his childhood संस्कृतम् teacher came and asked him "What is this सामज? What does it even mean, and why?"

  

He then goes on to explain whyसामज means an elephant.

  

"സാമഗാനം മഹർഷി ചൊല്ലിയപ്പോളാണ് ആനവന്നത്..അതും ഒരു വെളുത്ത ആന..എന്നൊരു ചരിത്രമുണ്ട് , ഒരു ഐതിഹ്യമുണ്ട് .."

meaning

"There is a legend/story that a white elephant came when the maharshi(s)sang the सामगानम् / सामवेदम्".

  

Hence सामज means elephant - साम्नो वेदभेदात् जायते इति, as*kalpadruma*and*vaachaspatyam*also state.

  

This story seems to be a variant of the one mentioned by शतावधानी Dr. R. Ganesh.

  

धन्यवादः

जयानन्दः

  

P.S.

The Muslim poet's story is equallyinteresting. As a teenager, he started gaining recognition for his Malayalam poems. Very soon, he realized that if he learnt संस्कृतम् in addition, he could take his poems to the next level. So he undertook a systematic study (under the tutelage of scholar Shri. K. P. Narayana Pisharody) and ended up becoming a scholar. He started writing lyrics for films as well. Most of his songs have a heavy infusion of संस्कृतम्. In fact, some of his very popular film songs are 100% संस्कृतम् , a feat mostly unheard of in other regional movie industries. His most famous songs are steepedin कृष्णभक्तिः!
