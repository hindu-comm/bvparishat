Namaste.

What is the significance of this?

Why did 8 elephants come out of brahmA's head while he was singing sAmaveda?

  

I mean, why elephants and sAmaveda?

What is the connection of the diggajAH and sAma? Is there something that is not obvious but relevant?

  

  

And didn't veda vyAsa categorize the Veda in four different ones that we know now? So, how come sAmaveda sung by brahmA, before that ?  
  

Apologies for any mistake or misunderstanding.

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
