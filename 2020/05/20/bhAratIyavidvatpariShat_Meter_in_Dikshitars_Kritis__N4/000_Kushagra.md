Respected Scholars,  
  
Are Sri Dikshitar’s Kritis in any standard meters?  
  
They do not seem to be in any वार्णिक छंद. However, the similarities across compositions and set tala structure may indicate the possibility of multiple मात्रिक छंद in different parts of any given kriti.  
  
If these compositions are indeed in any identifiable meters, do we have a list mapping compositions to meters?  
  
Thanks,  
Kushagra
