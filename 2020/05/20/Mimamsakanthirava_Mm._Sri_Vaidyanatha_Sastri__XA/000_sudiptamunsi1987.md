Dear Group Members,

I am looking for biographical and intellectual information about Mimamsakanthirava Mahamahopadhyaya Sri Vaidyanatha Sastri. I know that he was the pupil of the great Mahamahopadhyaya Sri Tyagarajadhvarindra alias Sri Tyagarajamakhindra alias Mannargudi Sri Raju Sastri and the Mimamsa teacher of Panditaraja Sastraratnaka Sri S. Subrahmanya Sastri. Further, he was the author of the Prabha tippani on the Tarkapada of Sabarabhasya. I have also heard that from both his parents' side he hailed from a family of Mimamsakas.

Any other information - biographical, intellectual and otherwise - will be of immense help. Sharing of the pdf of any other work by Mimamsakanthirava Mm. Sri Vaidyanatha Sastri will be highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance.

Best regards,  
Yours sincerely
