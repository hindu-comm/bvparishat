Dear Shri Vishvas ji

You underestimate the value that SJW bring to the public discourse.

Never before in the history of politics has the harried details agnostic public been given such a black and white choice.

That is no mean contribution.

The only deficiency i see is that it might make the political right lazy and complacent.
