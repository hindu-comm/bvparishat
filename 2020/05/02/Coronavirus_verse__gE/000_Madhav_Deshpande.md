Coronavirus verse

  

उदरभरणहेतो: कुर्वते स्वीयकार्यं

भुवि सकलजनास्ते प्रत्यहं सर्वदिक्षु ।

जगति कथमिदानीं जीवितं धारयन्तु

यदि सपदि करोनादुर्दिने कार्यहानि: ।।

  

In every direction in the world all people daily carry out their work to feed themselves. Now, during this tough time due to the Coronavirus, how can they support their lives if their work disappears?
