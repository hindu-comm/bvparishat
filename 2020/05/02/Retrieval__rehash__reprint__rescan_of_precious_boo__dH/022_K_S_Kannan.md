In addition, it should also be a good idea to publish a new

**Complete Works Series.**

**  
**

Sruti-smrti-itihasa-purana texts are respected by all the sects.

TTD should fund all such texts in a (more or less) uniform-sized series

each of (approximately) 500 pp Demy Octavo - all *originals only.*

All priced uniformly low : no profit basis, essentially.

Very few of these texts have copyright issues.

The spine of the book should give enough indication as to the contents of the books.  

  

All these should be very well edited:

headers and footers, as for example, in Belwalkar's URC,

which makes it so easy to search/refer.

  

Each should have a Contents in Detail Section;  

and Subject Headings throughout the book,

so that you do not need to get back to the Contents Page every time.

Most Sanskrit books are horribly edited in this regard.  

Plus good subject-index, (and numerous Appendixes

as in the 1960 *Artha-sastra* edition by NSVenkatanathacharya)

etc. etc.

  

Publishers of Sanskrit texts are notorious for their shoddy binding.

Some of the publications of Sri Satyanarayana Dasa are remarkable for their binding also:

Good margin, opening the book is a pleasure.

  

I have with me books printed a hundred years ago, some even more,  

yet still in tact and so easy to use: no fear that the binding will give way.

Pin-binding should be given a good-bye.

  

A second series of subsidiary texts, primarily commentaries on the above,

should also be similarly brought out.
