Thank you for your suggestion, Khangai-ji.

  

It does not matter that you happened to be "selfish";

all that is needed that it should be a good book worthy of reprint.

  

Some information alongside would be helpful:

\- full bibliographical details of the book

(preferably, when was it published last (or any other edition also + edition number),

year & place of publication, name of publisher, no. of pages etc.;

and also briefly, why you consider the book important).

  

That will help making decisions when that stage arrives.
