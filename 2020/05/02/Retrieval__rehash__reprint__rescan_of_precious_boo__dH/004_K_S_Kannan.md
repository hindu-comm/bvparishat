I guess even children cannot claim copyrights

60 years after the death of the author.

There is the famous case of the reprint of the works of

Rabindranath Tagore, when the Court gave this ruling.

Must check, in any case, with laws that are actually current.

  

Sometimes, even lawyers are at a loss to know

in regard to the latest laws!
