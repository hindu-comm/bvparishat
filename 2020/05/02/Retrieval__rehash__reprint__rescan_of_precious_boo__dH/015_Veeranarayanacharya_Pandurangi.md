This is one great idea coming forth in BVP.

It is long cherished dream.

We need to create

  

1 A web-based database of all Samskrit works. I proposed this to various agencies with out much success. Only a curtailed nyaya bibliography we could achieve. Hosted on ksu website.

  

2\. Single point e Text repository. Sa.Wikisource has done tremendous job.But next step is to be taken by ebharati sampat by consortium of RSVP and samskrita Bharati etc.

They have a great plan of using ocr to digitise books making them usable. Only thing is that it should start.

I have talked to Lakshmi Narasimha mahodaya about this.



Even Samskrit world of Dr Dhaval Patel is fantastic.

  

3\. Making a list of samskrita publishers and involvement of scholars expectations with them. This is quite need.

  

4 regular new arrivals should be in BVP. Narendran is doing it quite well. But most authors in BVP forum don't follow including me. We should it in priority basis.

  

5.Collecting details of theses in samskrita is necessary.

  

6.Bringing some of the foreign publications to India is also necessary. Institutional publishers abroad should be contacted for this purpose.

  

7.Making a secretariat with whichI will try my best to to organize a centre for dissemination of Samskrit publications in Bengaluru if I get some funding 25 k per month from Indic academy.

  

It should ultimately end with a huge database of all publications.
