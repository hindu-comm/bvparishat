Prof. Varakhedi's mail is very encouraging.

  

I consider myself a small cog in the big wheel of BVP.

All members should contribute their ideas

reg. good books deserving reprint.

  

A good selection from out of it should make the task

a plausible project fit to be taken up.

  

I am sure there are many who are competent in BVP

and are equal to the big tasks, my own role being  

the humble one of generating some helpful ideas.
