I do not know how this issue can be handled.

  

There are numerous books which need to be reprinted - some in a new format, even.  

Though many books are available as soft copies officially, a good many of them  

without copyright violation (and a few otherwise), there are many books  

which are just not available in the bookshops, and cannot be ordered on line:  

copies not available; all exhausted.

  

Is there a way publishers could be advised regarding  

the importance/need of a book to be reprinted ?

  

Just to cite an example. Some of the Purana-s had appeared as  

originals and translations by different publishers. Some publishers came up with the idea  

of bringing the two together - with text, translation, and Notes in a run-on fashion,  

or as text on the verso and translation on the recto etc.  

  

KASIyer's *Vakyapadiya*, for example, has only the English translation,  

and not the text alongside. It is an important text, and to read the beautiful translation *  
*

*along with the original* becomes quite important, howsoever good the translation may be.  

  

Can BVP, as an organisation, make suggestions to publishers? Has it been tried?  

Would the formation of an advisory committee for that feasible?

  

And how do things fare in the West? And do our own publishers have  

good advisory boards which can give a fair hearing to suggestions from academic bodies?

  

How about unnumbered small publishers not known beyond their cities?  

And how many cases of of author-cum-publishers simply faded into oblivion ! :

address changed, author no more, successors just unaware,

or not even keen on retaining copyrights, etc. etc.  

  

Also, is it possible to create a dynamic database of authors "deceased 60 years ago",  

so that their publications can be scanned/reprinted without fear of copyright violation?  

There are many scan-enthusiasts I guess, right in BVP, and and many more outside  

whom this info can help; and can help publishers.

  

The *unabridged* edition of Gajendragadkar's *Kavyaprakasha* is an item many badly miss!  

There are many excellent books that deserve reprinting, or at least a decent scan.

  

And surely, many books deserve a decenter scan, as they have been scanned  

in a hurry/roughshod manner - for example the recto page as verso and vice versa,  

as a consequence of which, the text-on-verso and the translation-on-recto format is missed  

as the fellow who scanned is insensitive to this ! And how many items even on [archive.org](http://archive.org)  

have mutilated/distorted spellings of titles/authors/publishers!

  

Do these problems have a solution? Can the government be petitioned to fund  

a rectification of the situation? Can BVP or an offshoot of it have some role here?

  

Points to ponder over.  

Reflections and suggestions if any welcome.
