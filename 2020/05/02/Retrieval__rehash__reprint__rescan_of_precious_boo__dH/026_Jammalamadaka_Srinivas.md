Namaste sir,

  

Why can't we think of more relavent than publishing? Why can't we try to create e-repositories? Such as Yoga Vaisharadi (<https://kymyogavaisharadi.org/>) and Advaita Sharada (<https://advaitasharada.sringeri.net/>) ? This will be a more relavent step for us. By this most of texts could be searchable and will be useful to create textual minmapping etc.

  

This is just asuggestion.

  

Namamsi,

Srinivas Jammalamadaka
