A capital idea.

  

Publishers must be given incentives for  

quality production, quality enhancement.

  

Unfortunate that thousands of copies of VSApte's Skt-Eng Dic

& SCBasu's SK were sold - all with botched print,

by one of the leading publishers in India - & for decades.

Such prints are reserved - reserved for local consumption;

good quality pieces are for export only

& for fancy prices.
