I do not know whether or why the erstwhile governments at Tamil Nadu and the Centre,

good in nexus on many political counts, never bothered to work in unison

when it came to issues pertaining to cherishing and nourishing our national heritage

of which all our regional literatures form an integral part.

  

They perhaps had more important issues to bother about.

  

It is time and again proved that many projects take off

only when headed by individuals passionate about their work,

and in addition buttressed (if fortunate) by governmental support,  

and the two work in tandem.  

  

What has happened for Tamil  

ought to happen for other languages also :

spirited private enterprise augmented and amplified  

by governmental infrastructure.

  

Most politicians are good in nothing but  

lip sympathy for our languages.
