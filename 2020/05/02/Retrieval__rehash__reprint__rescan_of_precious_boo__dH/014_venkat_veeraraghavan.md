TN and the ROI have been at cross purposes politically since the last 30 years and the dravidian goondas are fit for only stage rhetoric and cultural posturing.

So whenever state and center aligned as with DMK and Congress they had more important issues like 2G to concentrate upon.

Case closed.

But we can do something here if we get the organization right.
