You are right.  

The soft versions have multitudes of advantages, undoubtedly.  

  

Yet, both formats will be needed, and will continue.

  

If anything, books in print would first have ceased  

in the fields of science and technology. After all, that is a field

where ideas can get dated too soon : a dictionary of computer science

published 25 years ago would by now be already outdated. This is the age of  

encyclopediae getting constantly updated, almost every day.

  

Yet, is there one field where they have stopped publishing books?  

Any sign of it?

  

While most colleges give computer access to science students,

how many students in humanities are computer-savvy?

And how many among Sanskritists in particular?

  

The day science publications in hard print get discontinued,

it would be time to begin to think of applying similar criteria to Sanskrit texts too.

  

Hard print and soft print must go on in parallel.

There may be better ideas.
