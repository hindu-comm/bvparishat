Namaste sir,

  

This line in your email happened to catch my eye

  

> ..when I was exploring the possibility of coming out with translations > of certain fairly obscure old Bengali books.  

  

I was wondering if you were translating or considering translating these books from Bengali yourself. If you know Bengali, I would be very happy to hear your thoughts on a little program of translating the books of Shri Anirvan. If I may, could I please draw your attention to this thread:

Apologies for the random email, out of the blue!

  

Thanks and regards,

Sathya
