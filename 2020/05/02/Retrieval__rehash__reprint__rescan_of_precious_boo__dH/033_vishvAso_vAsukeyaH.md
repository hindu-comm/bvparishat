Also - <https://www.panditproject.org/> - Israeli indologists seem to be behind it.

Indeed! However, just a plain text repo is very useful - so contribute to <https://github.com/sanskrit/raw_etexts/> . Makes search a lot less painful.  
  
For example, this was part of an email sent by shrI vIranArAyaNa pANDurangi - "I request to make avaialble all purana and veda texts available in wikisource in text file mode. I talked with Shubha Bhagini here about the problems in searching in wikisourse. it does not search to our wish. suppose I wish to त्रिपादूर्ध्व wherever it occurs. If I search त्रिपा only it should search त्रिपादूर्ध्व. but it does not search it. it only searchs त्रिपा. Hence I need to get all the veda and purana files in my computer. so I can put it in text files. text files search these things very fine."
