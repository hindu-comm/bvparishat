This is the sort of thing the government can help with. For example, there could be a requirement for all publishers (both domestic and foreign) operating in India and generating above a certain level of income, to spend a small percentage of their budget on typesetting, correcting, and reprinting books that are valuable for preserving Indian cultural heritage. This way, people can be legitimately paid for doing this work, and valuable out of print books would become available again.
