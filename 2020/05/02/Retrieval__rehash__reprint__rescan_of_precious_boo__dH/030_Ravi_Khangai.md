Thank you, Prof. Kannan Sir,

The book was published in three volumes. I got the second and third volumes and they are a verygood interpretation of the Myths from the epic so I feel the first volume, which is out of print for long will be useful to the people who engage with the epic.

The details of the book

Title- Myths from the Mahabharata (in three volumes, out of which the first volume is out of print for long), 2nd vol published in 2001, third in 2002, I do not know about the publication year of the first volume.

Publisher- Aryan Book International, New Delhi,

Thank you once again
