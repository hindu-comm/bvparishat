Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

What you suggest is very important work.

  

However when it comes to publication of books whether paper or electronic, I guess demand will decide the viability.

The issue regarding copyright may have been transferred to children etc even after the death of an author.

Atleast this is what a lawyer told me when I was exploring the possibility of coming out with translations of certain fairly obscure old Bengali books.

As usual the legal ramifications are more likely to fully manifest after someone has done all the hardyards and come out with a book.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
