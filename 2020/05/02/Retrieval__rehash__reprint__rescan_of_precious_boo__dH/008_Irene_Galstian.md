Exactly as Prof Kannan said, though well-produced copies of certain books seem hard to obtain at any price, at least here in the UK. I find that the older the edition, the better its quality in terms of proofreading and typesetting.

By the way, I mentioned publishers since these are businesses already familiar with the process of book production. On a more global scale, all businesses operating in India could participate, whether voluntarily or by government initiative. India's contribution to humankind has been tremendous, and it's not unreasonable to ask businesses that operate in India (including, and perhaps especially large multinational companies) to preserve the riches India has produced. In doing so, not only India but the entire humanity would benefit.

  

BVP is in a good position to get the ball rolling in this matter. There are enough experts on the list to compile relevant works and oversee the process, so that remarkable works that aren't yet widely known would be included in the revival/reprint project and would become better known. It's a golden situation where only a good scholar would know such works, and the project would be overseen by the best representatives of Indian scholarship.
