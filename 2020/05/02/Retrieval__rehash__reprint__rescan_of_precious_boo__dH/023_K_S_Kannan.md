It would be nice if Indic Academy can conduct a few workshops

on Copy-editing for Sanskrit books.

Most Western publishers have paid copy-editors

which is why their books look so consistent, elegant, and user-friendly.

  

In a good many series of Indian publications,

Vol 1 and Vol 3 of the same series will be of very different sizes

\- as bad as Pingree's *Census* series.  

  

Indian publishers of Sanskrit books should pay attention to this,

and employ regular/full-time copy-editors.
