The Govt of Tamil Nadu ran a project several years ago called "Project Madurai" to get all Tamil Sangam literature and later works as well in electronic format, mostly retyped by volunteers. They have achieved tremendous success, though over a period of several years.

There are some individuals currently engaged in similar projects.

  

For example, Sri Ayee Narasimhachariyar of Melukote is publishing Jeeyar vyakhyanams of Upanishads in small manageable sizes every month. I am supporting him with proof reading the text once OCR converts scanned pages (pdf) into word files (in Sanskrit).

  

We need a team of volunteers who can work together under an umbrella for such a noble cause.
