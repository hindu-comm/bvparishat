Project Madurai was not a government project. It was the brain child of a single man, an academician in Lausanne, Switzerland. The gentleman's name is Dr Kalyanasundaram. He banded together a set of spirited volunteers and paired them off - one to data capture and another to proof read. He provided the print copy of the critical edition. This happened in the early 90s upon the advent of the Internet. By 1995 or so, many works were made available. Tamil was also way ahead of most Indian languages with volunteer produced fully functional keyboards, fonts and related software tools. They didnt wait for CDAC to show the way.  

  

They made available quite a few works. It went in two phases. In the first phase everything was made available in the then 7 bit encoding scheme (ISCII). Then later towards 1999-2005 timeframe everything was converted to Unicode. Still I think there were some ISCII encoded works which were never converted to Unicode. The Unicode available works number upwards of 700. Until 2005 or so, if you wanted a classic text (or sometimes its commentary) you first went to Project Madurai.  

  

Since 2008 or so, if you want Tamil classic texts and their commentaries, you have two ways:

  

1\. Online: There's a Tamil Virtual Academy which has most Tamil texts captured with commentaries. You can search based on first words of verse, chapter etc. Detailed paraphrases for many commentaries are also available - depending on whether they are in college/univ curriculum. This is entirely unicode.  

  

This facility has a digital library, in addition, where they carry about 85,000 scanned texts. The texts are of all kinds - not just those required for university degrees. The scan quality is way better than [archive.org](http://archive.org) which, I notice, this group swears by. This despite the original being of rather low quality.  

  

2\. Printed form - As somebody already pointed out, TN govt sometime back bought out rights to most out of print works by compensating family members of the deceased authors and gave the rights to any publisher for a nominal sum of Rs 500 or so. The result is that most obsolete works in demand are available in print now. The print quality in terms of paper and fonts are all very good but they all look similar because I suspect they're all mechanically typeset.  

  

In any case 2000 years of Tamil literature are available on-line. However all of these are texts published during or before the 1950s.  

  

  

Since about 2000 or so, most Tamils are spared the ignominy, torture etc of central government sites, [archive.org](http://archive.org) or other such sites for their text requirements, they would go to one of these sites.  

  

Hope this helps,
