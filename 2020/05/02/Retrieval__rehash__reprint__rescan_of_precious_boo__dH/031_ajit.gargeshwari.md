Dear Prof Kannan,

  

These are my suggestions

  

Scholars need to decide how many books to publish and in what areas.

  

Scholars can make a lists of books that are out of copyright and that are in copyright, in copyright out of print with publishers Once such lists are prepared, scholars can further decide if a book needs revision or not. If a book doesn't need revision It can be published as E books as they will be economical. E books can be just scans of the original books. If a book needs revision a willing scholar should take up such a revision. I suggest Print version and Electronic version for primary books and only Electronic version for secondary books.  

  

If scholars have old books which are rare and not already digitized they should be digitized first. Digitizing and making books available is also publishing, E publishing.

  

I don't know if Rastriya Sanskrit Sansthan have funding to publish rare and out of print books.

Regards

Ajit Gargeshwari
