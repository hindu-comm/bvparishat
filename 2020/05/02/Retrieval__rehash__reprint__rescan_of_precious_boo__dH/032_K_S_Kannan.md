Ajit Gargesshwari is doing great service by means of preparing

scanned versions of numerous books - a good many rare and unavailable ones.

  

Those who have good book collections can get good books scanned from him.

They must have a prior discussion with him wrt the terms and conditions required.

  

The suggestions of AG are welcome.

Other suggestions will also help.
