In the Hindi phrase “kām kāj”, I believe kām is cognate with Sanskrit karma and kāj is cognate with Sanskrit kārya.  In Hindi, is the word kāj ever used independently without being preceded by kām? Is there an equivalent Sanskrit phrase "karma kārya"? Or a Prakrit / Apabhramsha phrase with cognate words?
