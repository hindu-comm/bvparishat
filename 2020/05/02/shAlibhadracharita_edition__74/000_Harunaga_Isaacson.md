From a few pieces of secondary literature, such as Siegfried Lienhard's

History of Classical Poetry: Sanskrit — Pali —Prakrit (1984),

and an article by Maurice Bloomfield called The Śālibhadra carita:

A story of conversion to Jaina monkood (published in 1923 in the Journal

of the Americal Oriental Society), I learn that there is an edition

of the Śālibhadracarita (composed originally by Dharmakumāra and

apparently later revised/polished by Pradyumnasūri), published in Bombay in 1910,

in the Yaśovijaya Jaina Granthamālā. I have searched for a PDF of

this surely not in copyright book on [archive.org](http://archive.org), and on [jainelibrary.org](http://jainelibrary.org),

but without success. On [jainelibrary.org](http://jainelibrary.org) I have found a PDF of a more

recent edition, with commentary:<https://jainelibrary.org/book-detail/?srno=008969>;

however, though this is wonderful that this is available there,

I would be very glad if I could also consult the 1910 edition.

  

Municandravijaya, one of the two editors of the more recent edition,

writes of the 1910 edition that अधुनाऽप्राप्यप्रायमस्ति , which is true, at

least for me in the present circumstances. Might any scholar

on this list nonetheless be able to point me to a PDF?

  

With many thanks in advance,

Harunaga Isaacson
