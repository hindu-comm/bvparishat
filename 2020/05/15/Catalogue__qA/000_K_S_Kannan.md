Does anybody have (or has seen) a catalogue (old/recent) of the publications of

Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, Calcutta? (I have a suspicion they never produced one!)

  

And is it a single unit, or, like Chowkhamba, multiple?

If there is a scanned copy, I would welcome it

(the more so if it is a recent one - if it indeed exists).
