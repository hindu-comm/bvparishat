Namaste Mahodaya,

  

I am planning to take one XAI (explainable Artificial Intelligence) project for my thesis and I need a catalog of the Sanskrit documents (the work may be in any script like Sarada, Kannada, Malayalam, Devnagari, etc)

  

Someone in my close circle told me there are 1 crore official+ unofficialmanuscripts available within India which is including around 5L manuscripts which have gone out of India (legally+ illegally)

  

What I am looking for is the following metadata of all the manuscripts.

1\. Name of the document/work

2\. Author

3\. School/Gurukul Sakha/ Ved Sakha etc.

4\. Tentative year

5\. Category (Yoga, Ayurveda, Trigonometry, Metallurgy, Physics etc.

6\. Physical Location of the document (library/ temple/ matham)

7\. Digital location of that document (URL) (if digitized)

6\. Summary (1 paragraph) about the document

  

We want the above information about all the manuscripts in English and Devanagari both.

  

Can someone connect me to the right authority/person with whom I can connect and explore the project?

  

Warm Regards
