Oldest inscriptions in Sanskrit were sent in a separate thread yesterday by Svat as[Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayodhya_Inscription_of_Dhana "Ayodhya Inscription of Dhana"), and[Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hathibada_Ghosundi_Inscriptions "Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions")from the 1st century BCE. Both in Brahmi lipi.

  

The oldest Sanskrit language manuscript found is said to be the [Spitzer Mss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Manuscript)from 2nd century CE, written in Kushana Brahmi lipi.

  

Regards,

Sudarshan
