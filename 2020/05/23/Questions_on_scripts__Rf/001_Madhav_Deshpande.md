Dear Irene,

  

  Here is some info:

  

"One of the oldest surviving palm leaf manuscripts of a complete treatise is a Sanskrit[Shaivism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaivism "Shaivism")text from the 9th-century, discovered in[Nepal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal "Nepal"), now preserved at the Cambridge University Library.^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm-leaf_manuscript#cite_note-cupparameshplm-3))The[Spitzer Manuscript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitzer_Manuscript "Spitzer Manuscript")is a collection of palm leaf fragments found in[Kizil Caveras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kizil_Caves "Kizil Caves"), China. They are dated to about the 2nd-century CE and are the oldest known philosophical manuscript in Sanskrit.^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm-leaf_manuscript#cite_note-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm-leaf_manuscript#cite_note-5)")

  

  More recently found Buddhist Sanskrit/Gandhari Prakrit manuscripts that were discovered buriedin Gandhara region are being studied, edited and published by Richard Solomon from the University of Washington, Seattle, and a team from the British Museum. Here is a recent publication from this team:

  

Richard Salomon, The Buddhist Literature of Ancient Gandhāra: An Introduction with Selected Translations. Somerville, Mass.: Wisdom Publications, 2018. xxiv, 456 pp., ISBN 978-16-14-29168-8

  

  These Buddhist manuscripts date from the 1st century BCE to 3rd century CE, and are in the Kharoshthiscript.

  

  Otherwise, the Skandapuranabeing edited and published from Leiden uses an old 9th century A.D. manuscript. Among the several hundredmanuscripts used by the Bhandarkar Institute in preparing their Critical Edition of the Mahabharata, the oldest manuscript dates to the 15th century.
