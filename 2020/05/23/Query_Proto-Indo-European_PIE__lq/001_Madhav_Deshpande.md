Dear Megh Ji,

  

  "Proto-Indo-European" is a theoretically reconstructed ancestor of the languages belonging to the family called "Indo-European." It is not an actually attested language. It predates all the attested member languages. Similarly, Proto-Dravidian is a reconstructed ancestor of the languages belonging to the Dravidian language family. That is how these terms are understood in historical linguistics. With best regards,
