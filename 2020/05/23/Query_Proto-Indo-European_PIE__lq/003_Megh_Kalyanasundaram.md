Dr Deshpande,

  

Thank you for the response. Having read Dr Clackson's paper*[The Origins of the Indic Languages: the Indo-European model](https://www.academia.edu/9452122/_The_Origins_of_the_Indic_Languages_the_Indo-European_model_in_Angela_Marcantonio_and_Girish_Nath_Jha_eds._Perspectives_on_the_origin_of_Indian_civilization_New_Delhi_259-287)*(amongst others) and having cited that in a 2017 paper I was involved in, I was aware that PIE is effectively as an "artefact of a method". I was still curious if anything has changed or if it remains, well, unattested. Thank you, nevertheless, for your response.

  

Best,

Megh
