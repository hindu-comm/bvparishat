To get a casual flavour of PIE and other reconstructions (Proto-Indo-Iranian, Proto-Germanic etc), a nice page giving the same story in all of them is[this one (“The King and the God” in Proto-Indo-European and its Main Proto-Languages)](https://web.archive.org/web/20200523204402/https://academiaprisca.org/indoeuropean/kingandgod-fable.htm). See also [the page onSchleicher's fable](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Schleicher%27s_fable&oldid=956500217#Byrd_(2013))which gives different PIE reconstructions by different authors over time. (I think I originally found both these links from [Geoffrey Sampson's PIE page](https://web.archive.org/web/20200512045753/https://grsampson.net/Q_PIE.html).)

  

The [article on proto-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proto-language&oldid=931715162) points out that not just Proto-Indo-European but all the "proto-" languages are unattested almost by definition, with a few exceptions such as if you consider Latin or Sanskrit to themselves be proto-languages for the Romance or Indo-Aryan families.See also the ["Accuracy" section](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Proto-language&oldid=931715162#Accuracy) that mentions some issues such as ”reconstructions tend to have a strong bias toward the average language type known to the investigator”, and the spectrum of views from something like PIE being "linguistic reality" to just "a set of reconstructed formulae".  

  

For a language that old to become attested, either a reliable oral tradition (like that of Vedic recitation) or (alphabetic) writing in that languagemust turn up, and either would take basically a miracle, as I understand it. (Only a handful of languages have writing older than 2000 BCE even, according to [this table](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_languages_by_first_written_accounts&oldid=957873743#Before_1000_BC), and none of themare in an Indo-European language.) At any rate, it would be big news, even outside of linguistics, so we're likely to have heard of it. :-)
