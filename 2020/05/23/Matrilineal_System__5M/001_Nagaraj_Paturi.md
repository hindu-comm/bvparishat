There are sufficient studies in Cultural Anthropological studies on India where it is analysed with facts such as in which tribes, castes and or regions these family and marriage systems currently prevail.

  

Their mention in premodern literature is an interesting topic for study.

  

My view is that Vyasa's intention was as inclusion of his Cultural Anthropological observations with a cultural relativist perspective to such practices to inculcate the same in his audience.
