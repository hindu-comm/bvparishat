Is there mention of matrilineal system in ancient Sanskrit literature or ancient Tamil literature? I am not asking about matriarchy in which females function as the head of the household. Also not about countries ruled by women - the story of Alli and Arjuna is famous enough. This isdāya krama, the passing of inheritance, and also about the family one is considered as belonging to. In Kerala, it is called marumakkattāyam and in Tulunadu it is called aliya santāna.

  

If matrilineal system is mentioned in ancient Sanskrit or Tamil literature, is there also a mention as to where (which geographical region) it is practiced?

  

Matrilineal system is currently followed in Kerala and Tulunadu (southern parts of Karnataka including Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts).

  

On another note, there is mention of polyandry in Sanskrit literature - Panchali is a good example. Is there mention of polyandry in ancient Tamil literature? Do Sanskrit and Tamil literature mention the geographical region where it is practiced?

  

In southern Kerala, in and around the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram, many Nair families practiced polyandry to the modern times. A couple of our maids had two fathers - two brothers married to one woman. This was not only among the financially weaker sections.
When I was living in Thiruvananthapuram, I had an old colleague who once informed us of the passing away of his father and invited us to the sañcayanam function. More than a year later, he again informed us of the passing away of his father and invited us to the sañcayanam function. (Sañcayanam is the function associated with the gathering of bones from the funeral pyre and it appears to be a very important function for the Nairs, almost equivalent to the 13th day piṇḍa or śrāddha performed by the "higher" Hindu castes of Kerala.) I remembered the previous invitation and was surprised. I asked him who the person was who died the year before. It was then that he revealed that he had two fathers. Two brothers married his mother, at the same time. His family was not in anyway financially backward. They were among the land owning Nair families of his locality and were fairly well off.
