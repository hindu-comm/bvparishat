Respected sir,

  

After Using Advance Option (Pattern Search), I could be able to find 37 instances of आनर्च्छत् in Mahabharata. We are improving it more and very soon you would have a flexible search option with more encoding options where this kind of problems will not occur. At present, if you have some idea about pattern matching or regular expression, you can use advance search option.
