Sir,

 Could you tell me which corpus of Mahabharata is being used for search?

If it is only the main text (excluding footnotes and appendices) of the critical edition, it is not that useful.

I search forआनर्च्छत्, but I do not get any result. But definitely it occurs in Mahabharata (Gita Press).

Regards

Narayan Prasad
