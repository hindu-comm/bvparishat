There is nothing strange about it, because it is a "**kumulatives Nachtrags**wörterbuch **zu** den Petersburger Wörterbüchern (pw) von Otto Böhtlingk und den Nachträgen von Richard Schmidt" (= "a **cumulative supplementary** dictionary **to** the Petersburg dictionaries (pw) by Otto Böhtlingk and the supplements by Richard Schmidt"-  
  
Description:  
  
"\[...\] For a more detailed assessment of the search results, the following remarks about the construction of the portal and its three components, the NWS (left), pw (middle) and Schmidt (right) may be of help. First of all, the object of the project funded for three years by the DFG was a cumulative search of a large number of „Nachträge“ (addenda), which resulted in the NWS (left). The left window will display only information not contained in pw or Schmidt. This means that, for instance, the dictionaries of Edgerton and Grassmann are not contained in the NWS as a complete set of data, merely what is missing in the pw is given. The idea behind the portal was to allow the user to review all three sources of lexical information at a glance. The data of the pw and of Schmidt were given to our project for this purpose by Thomas Malten, Köln. Basically they are identical with the data in the background of the Cologne Dictionary Project, but there are obvious modifications to the presentation on screen, and perhaps more importantly, we have started to apply our own corrections to the data, which will thus fork into a new śākhā.  
  
Unfortunately this history of the portal needs to be kept in mind for using the search tools. Only the addenda in the NWS were fully tagged by the present project, whereas the data from the Cologne project could not be reworked in this way. For this reason, all specifications of search only apply to the left window. The same limitation affects the information popping up during lemma entry: the suggestions are taken from a list of NWS lemmata, not of pw lemmata! It is also worth noting that the popups are not static, but change with further inputs. If one tries to search for vyavahāra, entering the first six letters produces the correct lemma. If one continues entering letters, the system produces further lemmata, for instance compounds as vyavahārapāda etc., which are generated from NWS entries only. The difference is made clear when one actually starts the search, which yields many more hits. \[...\]"
