Thank you Anil for that tip.

This should be mentioned right next to the search field.  

  

A sincere feedback.

Do consider input in Roman also.

And allow loose search.

E.g. allow hrasva and deergha matching for same vowel.

Dasa should match दश, दास, दशा, दस,

Kula to match कुल, कूल

  

This will help in two ways.

\- If searcher doesn't know exact spelling, will still get results.  
- Two, it gives related words, and one discovers new things.

  

Is the corpus , back data available for programtic usage? E.g. if I want to process the data through my own code, would it be available? Or is the data not available except through this interface.

  

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
