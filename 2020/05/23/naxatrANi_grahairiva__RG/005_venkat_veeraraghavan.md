Dear Shri Sankara ji:

  

"How are the nakshatras tormented by grahas? Please explain."

  

We have to get basics clarified first. What is a graha and nakshatra and what is its relevance in Viduraniti which deals with the ethics behind the doings of men?

Much has been written about Grahas harrassing nakshatras in the MB as well where Bhishma, Karna and Krishna among others discuss the cosmic precursors of the great war.

  

I am sourcing something that I wrote on the subject of "graha" Please understand that I am no scholar in this matter and merely sharing a personal perspective.

  

The actual position of the planets is a physical cosmic marker much alike a pedestrian crossing. When you see the traffic lights on your road turn red, you intuitively know that the pedestrian crossing (perpendicular to this road) will turn green soon and you prepare to cross the road.

Although this example might seem rather simplistic as an analogy for jyotisha it is a useful one to explain the heuristics behind predictive jyotisha.

In the sense of the above analogy, the Grahas and their positions do not "cause" the karma as many modern "rationalists" argue but merely indicate that certain karmas have become imminent.

Graha is also a few degrees more complicated in its nature than merely being thought of as a consciousness to a planet. A Graha is sourced from the Sanskrit world meaning "to hold" which means it is an entity that "holds" awareness and constrains the mind and hence the destiny to play out in specific patterns.

Consider the puranic tale that Ravana had imprisoned all the 9 planets and made steps out of them to his throne. Narada the celestial troublemaker supposedly incites his vanity to make him turn Shani's face over so that Ravana can enjoy his anguish...apparently Ravana's fall started from there.

And then the story of Ravana forcing all the grahas into the 11th house of Meghnaadha's kundali and Shani puts a foot into the 12th which ends in Indrajit's eventual defeat and death.

Now ask yourself this: if what is being discussed is the spirit /consciousness of the planets, shouldnt the invincibility extend to all manifested beings (of that space-time) and not just Ravana and Indrajit?

The answer to the above question is an obvious unqualified NO.

Therefore there is something deeper at work here.

  

When an object is placed in front of a heat source, its thermals, molecular structure and the optics around it change.

A Graha is an entity that "holds" the personality constraining the object (it holds) to certain life patterns. If the object of this influence is capable of modifying the way a graha acts on the body-mind-spirit complex, this equates to having achieved control over the "graha".

This also satisfies the condition that other people within the same space-time do not receive the effect of these "manipulations".

  

A nakshatra is defined as ***"that is approached by the moon/chandra"***.

Pauranically (and in jyotisha) this refers to the story of Chandra and his wives the constellations and his favorite Rohini where he is exalted.

  

The Pauranic story will bring to fore the question how something proximal affects /afflicts something far more distant.

  

Now Chandra in jyotisha represents (among others) the Mind.

And as per anda-pinda nyaya as without-so within.

  

The 27 nakshatras represent the 27 different areas where the Mind /awareness dwells.

  

You will agree that without the mind as "meddleman" (alright I meant to write middleman but this works too :) ) pleasure and pain have no value....experiential value that is.

  

There are some shastras that also describe how the "amritakalasha" travels from one part to a different part of the body in sync with the phases of the moon. A lot of this is applied in Kalari/marma/varma vidya.

  

The nakshatra in this case would refer to a certain part of the psyche that is held to a certain mindset or pattern of thought by the Graha.

  

Depending on the nakshatra and graha in question different effects result.

  

So what is being "harrassed" / "tormented" by the graha (that which holds) is a certain part of the psyche ...this perversion of individual psyche in a critical mass of people can affect the whole society much alike the stock market.

  

Consider the USD and other fiat currencies..they have "value" because enough people with power believe so.

The stocks of companies have value because enough people perceive them to have one.

  

So what we are looking at here is money or stocks as a vector for value...rather than having intrinsic value.

  

So also, when a nakshatra is tormented by a graha, human behaviour changes in accordance unless the person in question is some sort of mahapurusha.

  

I hope this clarifies.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
