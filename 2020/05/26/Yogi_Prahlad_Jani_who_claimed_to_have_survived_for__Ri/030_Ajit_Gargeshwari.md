"A general overbearing skepticism is evident among Westerners in general,  

and scientists in particular (including scientists in India, by and large),

in regard to any accomplishment, especially by anyone in the East  

(especially any ancient knowledge), even if he be he the most accomplished even,  

till they can themselves get to explain them.

Looting knowledge systems of other heritages, and making money out of it  

is but their creed and tradition"

  

My writing The above two sentences are equally applicable for a believer and non believer They are statements of a general nature and may or may not apply to yogis who perform miracles. why should one not be sceptical and question? Haven't miracles performed in the west questioned ? it has been .Have not Easterners looted their own heritage allowed foreigners to rule and make money. If I say 'I saw a Golden eagle flying in the sky and the Eagle spoke to me about the future and that is correct. If you don't agree you might be in for big trouble. Please non believers disprove me' Will any one beileive me? If I have a propaganda expert with me then large section of believers will come to my rescue else no one. I have read from great saints siddhis acquired are impediments to further spiritual progress. Siddhis are not be demonstrated
