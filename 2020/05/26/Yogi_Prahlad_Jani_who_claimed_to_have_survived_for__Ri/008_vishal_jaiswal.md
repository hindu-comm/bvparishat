Just wanted to add that what we call death due to some cause in such a case can be entirely voluntary after such yogis have accomplished their purpose in their current lifetime and moved on.

  

This is just to counter random speculations saying how can he die of something trivial after having lived miraculously for so long.

  

A case in point being the last known apostle of hathayoga, Paramhansa Madhavdasji who left this planet at age 122 apparently due to malaria.

Neither him nor his direct disciple Shri Yogendraji (my guru) are known in modern life like the other popular ones like Iyengar, etc. They did their work silently in yoga for yoga.

  

The final words uttered by Shri Yogendraji in 1989 before leaving were,

"The modern world is not ready for yoga as yet."

It sums up the current state of affairs very succinctly.
