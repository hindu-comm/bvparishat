A healthy skepticism, I have clearly asserted, is quite desirable.

  

Acquisition of *siddhi*-s is, as you have correctly pointed out,

is discouraged in the *s'Astra*-s for a serious student of *adhyAtma*  

\- though their truth as such is not denied. There may not be many  

who have been able to attain one or more of the *siddhi*-s,  

and many, in fact, do not wish to come to the fore either.

  

It would be wrong, you would agree too, if wrong claims of attainments are publicly made,

or if they are dismissed off-hand without proper and patient investigation.

  

Yes, the less we speak about the "black sheep" the better,

yet their very existence need not be denied either.

And due care must constantly be taken - for correction of  

errors issuing from biases and ulterior motives.

  

Is there anything else?
