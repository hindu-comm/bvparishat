Alright if you are offended, I have no problems withdrawing that.

  

You are free to share or not share depending on personal context.

Each person shining a little light only makes the room brighter and with less dark/blind spots.

You keep going back to the belief system of people.

Is there anything we can do to change that?

No.

People will believe what is convenient for them to believe until there is good reason not to do so.

The reasons are usually emotional and not rational.

  

Neither I not any of the others have suggested a believer versus "science" debate here.

The problem is what masquerades as science today is a cult following the people blindly believe without looking closely at the data and the methods.

Health, finances and language are everybody's business.

Basic minimum literacy is essential in order to survive.

Unfortunately due-dligenceis not high on the minds of disciples.

  

How many even know how to test a Guru or what to test for?

One can learn only after3-4 bad experiences, reflection and bad judgement.

As in that bad joke: Good judgement comes from bad experience which comes from bad judgement.
