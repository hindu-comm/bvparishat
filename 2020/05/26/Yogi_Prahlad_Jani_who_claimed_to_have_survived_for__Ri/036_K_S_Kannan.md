A mere negative approach may not take us too far.

  

Non-believers are free to say I do not understand this or like to believe this.

It is only if they say these things are impossible- even without a proper investigation

that the problem starts. If they have not come across people who make valid claims,

all they can claim is that they have not come across clear proofs of these claims.

  

But it is when they theorise/generalise and insist that such things are just impossible

that the real problems start.

  

Tall claims either on this side or the other are not proper, after all.

There have been many scientists too who have made very tall claims,

one should not forget. Human frailties these all are.

  

There can be genuine areas of investigation

where these frailties do not figure.

It is to them that we need to give attention.
