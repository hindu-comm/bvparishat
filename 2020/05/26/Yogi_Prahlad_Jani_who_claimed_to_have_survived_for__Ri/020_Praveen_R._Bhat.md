The khechri process is far from physical! There are some that consider it as some chemical secretion from the pineal gland (and some conspiracy theories have done rounds about people drilling holes to reach it and tap it "from others" or oneself!)  
  

The yoga-/kunDalini-shAstras state that this khechri-siddhi is not only in the tonguereaching deep enough to tap the drip but also for the drip to be converted to amrita. That may take a lifetime or more. Else it is viSha. A short test mentioned for this is: if it tastes bitter or salty, its viSha; if it tastes sweet, it is amrita. The blessing of the Guru in haTha yoga is needed as much as in shaktipAt, for amrita!
