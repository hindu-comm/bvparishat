There is already a vast body of literature of scientific investigations of Yoga.

The pioneer in the field is, of course, Swami Kuvalayananda of Kaivalyadhama, Lonavala.

  

But now one will have to pore through countless medical journals  

(and popular /non-technical (mis)representations) just to get to know

how much of yoga has been investigated by science,

how many claims made, how many investigated,

how many upheld, and how many rejected etc. etc.

  

Much has been done, much much more remains to be done.

  

It would also be interesting to know how many investigations had to be deferred,

how many earlier verdicts pronounced by science have had to be modified or rejected etc.

And how many experiments were well done, how many ill done etc. too.

  

The literature is already too vast, and worse, too scattered,  

and in some of the remotest journals and reports and publications  

\- private as well as public.  

  

Would have been good if someone could write a book on the lines of  

George Cardona's famous work for Sanskrit grammar viz. *Panini: A Survey of Research,*

for the field of yoga also.

  

A book such as this with constant updates  

would indeed prove very vital.

  

BTW, such surveys of research are required for every *s'Astra,*

and indeed, every department of Indology in general.

  

(Could Indic Academy inspire scholars to take up these as various small projects

and help/guide them?).

  

A grand blueprint and roadmap must indeed be devised to conceive of and execute  

a research project on the lines of Joseph Needham's work on China.

Needham had leftist leanings, and so an unbiased and careful, yet non-cynical approach

is very much warranted here. The task is formidable going by the enormity of the material

available, both printed and unprinted.
