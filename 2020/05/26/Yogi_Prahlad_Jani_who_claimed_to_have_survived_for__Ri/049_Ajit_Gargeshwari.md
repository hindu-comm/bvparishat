I would have not written this much If We are not discussing belief vs science here. We are not discussing the cliched religion vs science too
you are right

  

I was only writing to these lines for I have received explanations and am satisfied.

  

A general overbearing skepticism is evident among Westerners in general, Western investigator  
to rather cast aspersions on the veracity of what has been stated  
as a matter of actual experience.  
Rather than make amends with their own language, (Westerners) they rest contented vilifying and calumniating  
what lies beyond their own ken, or the "ken" of their own tongues.

Problems started in the West when the Church tried to scuttle science

and persecute scientists. Science grew skeptical of all religious claims.

There has no been persecution of scientists in India in general.

Apparently, the Abrahamic faiths give a license to loot and plunder

all "others", the heathens and the pagans. Western contempt of the East

had its genesis here, and is a continuing legacy yet.

This combination of factors - of scientists getting skeptical of all "religious" claims,

and of the West disdaining the East - has led to the current situation of  

scientists irresponsibly dismissing off-hand any claim made by yogi-s,

some of whom did have, and do have, many attainments to their credit.

The attitude of the scientists that they can sit in judgement upon everything on earth,

despite costly lessons, is what is hindering a correct and full understanding of the situation.

Scientists poohpoohed yoga and ayurveda for quite some time,

but are ceding space by and by. It is when they speak in an arrogant tone

that they need to be shown their place.
