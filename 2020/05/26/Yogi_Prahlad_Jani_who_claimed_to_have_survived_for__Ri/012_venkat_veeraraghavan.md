Dear Dr. Kannan:

  

I failed to add this:

  

The unkindest cut of all does not come from academics or journos who like hyenas have their own bellies to fill and can be "understood".

  

Shri Rambhau Swami of Tanjore who is famous for his agni stambhana attracted his share of sceptics who all had to leave scratching their head despite tests conducted on him and the clothing he wore.

  

A friend of mine a spiritual type told me that he has read of herbs that can prevent fire from burning.

I asked him for a demo.

  

He has not taken me up on that yet...:)

  

As I said, we lack shraddha and bhakti even when we are supposedly "aastika".

Vyasa's / sanatkumara's words are not enough for us.

  

 It has to be backed by "scientific" proof and approval.

  

We are the same people who will chant "vyaasaya vishnu ruupaaya.." and then jump up and down that some scientist has backed some claim in the upanishads.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
