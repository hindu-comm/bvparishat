Dr. Kannan:

  

Thank you for the conferred Doctorate.

Is this the way "Vasishtar vaayaalBrahmarshi" works?

  

I thought you were Tamizh? Correct me if I am wrong.

  

I think you have remembered the story of Paramaartha Guru...Here both the Guru and his disciples are idiots..ek se badkar ek.

  

I am sure there must be a good proverb. Tamizh is rather expressive.

  

Venkat
