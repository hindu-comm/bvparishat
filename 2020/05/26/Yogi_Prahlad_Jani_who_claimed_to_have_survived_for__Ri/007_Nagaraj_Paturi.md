What 'surviving on the amrita secreted due to khechari-siddhi ' translates into the language these 'objective', 'empirical', 'logical positivist' 'researchers' is very difficult to say.

  

For me, proof of the pudding is in its eating.

  

The 'theory' to explain this, if it comes from a Hatha Yoga language and it is not translatable into the language that these people understand, that does not disprove anything. I don't mean that you are talking about disproving. I am talking about these scienticistsceptics,
