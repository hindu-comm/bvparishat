Agreed Venkatji, I am a certified yoga teacher from my guru's institute, but personally, the certificate means nothing to me. The spirit of a genuine yogi is reflected by the very life he leads, which is open for all to evaluate (technically yamas and niyamas among others). I am not comfortable catering to the asana circus, so have decided not to teach.

  

Regarding the term apostle, yes I used it in the secular way, just as I would apply catholic in the secular sense to yoga.

But I will try to choose something more appropriate next time.

  

Sadly, I grew up as an english snob, so my hindi is very pedestrian, and I can claim native fluency only in english so far. Thanks to yoga, I am deconditioned, and hope to achieve the same fluency in Samskrita as well as several other indian languages.
