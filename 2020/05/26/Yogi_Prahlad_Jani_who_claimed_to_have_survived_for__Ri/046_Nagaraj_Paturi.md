Dear Sri Ajit-ji,

  

1\. No one has said anything disallowing the progress of science.

  

2\. Sri Prahlad Jani-ji did not 'demonstrate' / 'perform' any siddhi. He was a saadhaka of a certain Devi upaasanain which even a male saadhakadresses as a woman as part of the procedures of saadhana. That is the main aspect of his saadhana. People might have noticed that he was not taking food or water. The word would have spread. Such information certainly makes into news and 'tests' etc. are the natural fallouts.

  

3\. What is a 'miracle' is quite often relative. Knowing the 'language' of birds and animals is considered to be a vibhooti in Yoga Sutras. In the text, it is advised that a great empathy with all the creatures can lead to this. Farmers can understand the 'language' of their pets and cattle. They can 'speak' to them too. This is a result of their love for their pets and cattle. For others who do not possess such ability, it might appear to be a miracle. The logic of the text is vindicated to an extent through this. Greater and greater such love and empathy with greater and greater number of creatures can lead to greater and greater levels of this ability.

  

4\. Kanchi Paramacharya survived on a very small quantity of a morsel made of flake powder and lemon juice or something like that for decades. In my own house, my own father survived on such little quantity of extremely insipid food. He used to be more productive than most of us. He used to engage in high energy consuming deep and advanced scholarly and spiritual pursuits 0 hours a day. He used to explain the sufficiency of such a small amount of sleep in terms of the small amount of food he used to consume.

  

5.I encountered many Yogis in the Srisailam caves surviving without food or water , using some breathing techniques. This particular Yogi under discussion too has been mentioned in the news item as a breatharian Yogi.

  

6\. We are not discussing belief vs science here. We are not discussing the cliched religion vs science too. We are discussing one knowledge system vs another. Science is a knowledge system, a young one at that. Yoga , Ayurveda etc. are knowledge systems too. Much much senior to this thing called science. Validity of these senior knowledge systems need not be measured upto this young one. Even among the contemporary academic fields, laws of one field do not get tested or proved by the methods of another field. I can not and need not prove a law of economics in a Physics laboratory.

  

7\. The wiki page mentions a 2006 Discovery Channel program titled "The Boy with Divine Powers" . The boy here is a Buddhist monk. Sri Prahlad Jani-ji appears in the interview just as a matter of course. The common point is the scienticistcuriosity about the ability to survive without food for long periods. The link for the video provided on the wiki page :<https://archive.org/details/TheBoyWithDivinePowers>  

  

8\. There is a warning during certain videos, activities performed are performed by experts. "Do not attempt the tricks or any stunts and tricks displayed in the videos. Most of these stunt performers are skilled professionals or simply very lucky people. TRYING THESE TRICKS COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS INJURY, INCLUDING PARALYSIS, OR EVEN DEATH." "Do not attempt the tricks or any stunts and tricks displayed in the videos. Most of these stunt performers are skilled professionals or simply very lucky people. TRYING THESE TRICKS COULD LEAD TO SERIOUS INJURY, INCLUDING PARALYSIS, OR EVEN DEATH."This applies to 'miracles' / 'miraculous behavior' by Yogis too. Science looks for replicability of an activity. But there are many activities that are not replicable by every other person. That does not disprove their factuality.

  

9\. The wiki page mentions two kinds of scientific tests. While reporting tests by certain groups from outside India, it mentions words such as 'cheating' used by those groups. It may be a balanced reporting to mention such views of the sceptics alongside the reports of testing by DIPAS .While discussing the news, we covered them under sceptics. So they received attention they deserve, here.

  

10\. This forum is a forum discussing Indic knowledge Systems. It is quite natural that it does not like the knowledge system of its focus to be subservient to another knowledge system called science.

  

May the knowledge system called science progress. May studying, reviving, putting to contemporary use of Indic Knowledge Systems progress. May shielding of IKS from being confused for religion, faith, belief etc. progress.
