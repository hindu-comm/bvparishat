I don't find any connection between what you say to a belief which a believer can have which cannot proved or disproved with the knowledge of science one has at hand as of now. One need not bring in what western church does or doesn't do. Yogi Prahalad ji according to believer demonstrated yogic techniques for which science has no answer. He did miracles which is not accurately documented and has not been verified by independent sources. That does not stop a believer from believing neither does this mean scientific methods which science employs based on axiomatic truths is the only way and has all answers
