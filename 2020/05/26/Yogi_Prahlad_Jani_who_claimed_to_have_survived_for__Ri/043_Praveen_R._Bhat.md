This is a good point. The siddhi/s, that would otherwise block samAdhi for a sAdhaka, become a tool in the hands of a siddha. There are following purposes to siddhi/s AFAIK:

1\) marks progress.

2\) serves as a test as to the readiness of the sAdhaka for the final goal, akin to that put by Yamaraja in Kathopanishad.

3\) removes doubts of the sAdhaka as to being limitless/bigger than the upAdhi of the body.

4\) in the hands of the siddha, it can be used for lokasangraha.

5\) a siddha may use it as "an advertisement" to attract people to the path.
