Dear Vishal ji-  

  

Please try and find a better word than "apostle" as a moniker for mahapurushas. Despite its "secular" meaningI believe our languages are rich enough to express without bothering to borrow from the abrahamic faith.

I agree with everything you say.

Partly to blame is the kaccha nature of wannabe sadhakas in this day and age.

They want everything like fast food served on a plate for a comfortable price.

They therefore routinely end up with bs spewing trash talking gurus with a glib and urbane manner and an opinion on everything from fashion to politics.

I guess one gets what one pays for.

The other side of this coin is someone who learns a little and goes into "business" for himself/herself.

  

  

Dr. Kannan is right on almost every count and a lot of this has to do with the way the modern Indian family as the smallest cell of social structure has developed.

Something has to come from the "west" for it to be "cutting edge" enough for adoption by their children.

I guess 200 years of servitude does not die that easy.

  

Now when a person does not claim their ancestral property it is but natural that someone from outside lays the claim. Thats the way the world works.

No surprises there.

I believeISKCON grew in India after Prabhupada came back with his dancing "white elephants". It is another matter whether Prabhupada's wish was achieved in so doing.

Yoga took an upswing again after Krishnamachary, BKS and others expanded to the west.

Lets face it: We lack shraddha and bhakti which is why we look outwards for validation.

  

Dr. Kannan --> The scientists and their ilk can be excused their snobbery, but definitely not the journalist who writes tripe in the name of journalism.



There are different elements of kechari siddhi in different schools raja yoga/ hatha / kriya / tantra etc.

I am not sure about origins which originated where, but kechari and amrit paan is a well known term used across tantric and yogic circles which interconnect at different levels so as to be indistinguishable.

for ex: in Hatha milking the tongue is adviced along with the use of rock salt to cut the frenum linguae

in Kriya there is a technique talabyakriya to achieve the same without the milking or cutting with externals.

In tantra they have a different marma sthana where the tongue exerts pressure.

The common aspect of all these techniques is that without the spiritual competence in terms of awakening of prana and chittashuddhi the tongue's length is of little use even if the complete technique is known.



As in all things praaptam is required. Most fatalists stop there. The segue goes like this...

And praaptam comes from karma properly applied.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
