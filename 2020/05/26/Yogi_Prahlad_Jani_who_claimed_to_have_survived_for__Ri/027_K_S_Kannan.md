My statements pertain to those who think on the lines that  

beliefs need a sound basis or a proper investigation.

I have no quarrel with those who say believers have their right  

to believe whatever they like.

  

Attitudes often have a long history. There lay my need to

point to the genesis of the issue being discussed.

  

As long as prejudices do not colour the investigations,

there is no problem. Bias and arrogance vitiate truth,

whether on the side of the investigators or the "subjects" -

is all I wanted to say.

  

There is much wisdom, I feel, in your last statement.
