Ajit ji:

  

Gassing was not a reference to you or any one else in particular.

Its a generalobservation.

If your objection is wrt formality much of the language on BVP will require moderation.

  

Personal experience is what counts in such topics and not so much theory.

A lot has been written about khechari here that will not stand experiential scrutiny.

But i guess to each his own.

  

Regards,

V
