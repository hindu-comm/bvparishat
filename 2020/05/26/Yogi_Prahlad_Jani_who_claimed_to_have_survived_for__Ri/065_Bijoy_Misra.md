Friends,  

Science विज्ञान necessarily demands an open mind.

Objectivity demands that bias of all kinds must be set aside to investigate.

I have seen lately some people assuming science to be शास्त्र, it is not.

Much of the western work on India fails because of the built-in bias in seeing through skepticism.

A scientist is not skeptical, all observations have to be believed in order to establish the cause.

Discovery of fraud is also science. There is fraud in society. Most fraud is based on economy and social transactions.

Any profiling is not science.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
