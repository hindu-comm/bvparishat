Rightly have you pinpointed, Prof. Paturi,

on the inadequacies of their own languages

that inspires the typical Western investigator  

to rather cast aspersions on the veracity of what has been stated

as a matter of actual experience.

  

Rather than make amends with their own language,

they rest contented vilifying and calumniating  

what lies beyond their own ken,  

or the "ken" of their own tongues.

  

To use a not so dignified, nevertheless not very incommensurate, analogy:

निन्दति कञ्चुकि-कारं

प्रायश्शुष्क-स्तनी नारी ॥
