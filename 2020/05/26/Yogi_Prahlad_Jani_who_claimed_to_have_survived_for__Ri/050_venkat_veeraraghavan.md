Dear Dr. Kannan:

Thank you for correcting me.*tapashshakti it is!*

*Shri Paturi Garu*****has pretty much covered it.

  

Many such yogis actually do not seek attention. Their disciples and hangerson are another cup of tea altogether!

A certain disciple of Radhanath Swami of Chowpatty was saying that "Maharaj was dancing like Chaitanya Mahaprabhu".

I asked him if he had had darshan of CM.

Rest assured I was not popular.

Kaccha disciples project their ego/aspirations on a Guru and tomtom even when the Guru does not have a desire.

And usually when someone extraneous tries to put something/someonewhere it does not belong, nature has a way of bringing it down.

For precisely these reasons and precedents like Ravana even highly accomplished yogis remain fearful of a fall and act like nonentities.

  

The Buddha Boy Ram Bahadur Bomjan was similarly hounded by paparazziright into the deeps of the Nepali forests.

What was the boy's fault?

People could not see the miracle of a 16 year old sitting without moving a muscle for 10 12 hours they were busy wondering if he was scarfing macas on the sly.

So typical of leaving the purse of gold to chase after the sow's ear and very apposite to our times!
