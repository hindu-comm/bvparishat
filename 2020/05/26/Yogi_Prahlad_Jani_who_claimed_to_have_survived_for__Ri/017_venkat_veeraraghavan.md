You have a big project. Mastering 9.

  

Talk to Smt Irene Galstian.  

  

She knows around 11.

She should be able to help you get the specifics ironed out.

  

I believethe worldis better aligned for polyglottony (did I just make up a word?)

Gluttony starts with the mouth as does speech so there is a case to be made there!

  

You have italki apps that can help source native speakers, youtube videos and even excellent reading material.

  

The important thing is to find the time, discipline and persistence to hack through the initial inertia.
