The more important task is to sensitize scholars to the various desiderata.

Conducting regular workshops even if on a small scale regarding the various

departments of knowledge and the numerous issues in various s'Astra-s

will prove an effective starting point.

  

Now that on-line seminars are coming into vogue, even if inevitably,  

this situation must be well exploited to expose scholars to various modern-day needs.

  

One of the important issues is to involve and inspire good and spirited students  

of science and technology to learn Sanskrit well and specialise in at least one *s'Astra.*

The govt. must institute special scholarships/incentives for multi-disciplinary work.

  

Even if the beginnings are humble,  

it can soon zoom into handling massive tasks/projects.
