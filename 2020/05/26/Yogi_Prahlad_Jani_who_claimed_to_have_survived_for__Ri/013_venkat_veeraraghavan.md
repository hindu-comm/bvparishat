Shri Vishal ji-->

  

From one English snob to another..Hello!

  

One of my pet peeves against my mother is that she did not let me learn Tamizh (my mother tongue) because it was ostensibly difficult to write and marks were not that easy to come by (of all reasons).

  

I therefore settled for being mediocre in Hindi. Most of my Hindi developed thanks to movies and friends (Rajastanis/Gujjus..Punjus who would not use any language except Hindi in pvt conversation)...

  

I still regret that I do not have the capacity to appreciate Kamban despite being able to read the script.

It irritates me no end that I have to depend on an English transliteration of Thirumantiram.

  

I guess this is all shared baggage from colonial past where we are taught from the cradle to look down upon ourselves!
