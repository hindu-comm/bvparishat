There was a grave typo:

  

Kanchi Paramacharya survived on a very small quantity of a morsel made of flake powder and lemon juice or something like that for decades. In my own house, my own father survived on such little quantity of extremely insipid food. He used to be more productive than most of us. He used to engage in high energy consuming deep and advanced scholarly and spiritual pursuits ***20*** not 0 hours a day. He used to explain the sufficiency of such a small amount of sleep in terms of the small amount of food he used to consume.
