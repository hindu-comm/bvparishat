" The unkindest cut of all does not come from ***scientists*** or journos who like hyenas have their own bellies to fill and can be "understood". "  

  

I meant to write scientists and it came out as "academics".

Apologise for the error.

  

The problem with science is that it has become a new age religion with its own evangelists like Dawkins and Tyson. A big departure indeed from Galileo, Gauss and Newton.
