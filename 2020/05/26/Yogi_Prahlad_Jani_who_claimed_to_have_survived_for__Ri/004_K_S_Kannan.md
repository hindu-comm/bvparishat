A general overbearing skepticism is evident among Westerners in general,  

and scientists in particular (including scientists in India, by and large),

in regard to any accomplishment, especially by anyone in the East  

(especially any ancient knowledge), even if he be he the most accomplished even,  

till they can themselves get to explain them.

  

The general tone of their temerity is

"Whatever we cannot comprehend or repeat or explain at the moment, is all, after all, nonsense".

And once they are able to grasp something out of it, and discern the element of truth in the same,

they would make all claims without compunction, as to "their own discovery" of the same,

coupled by the smug contemptuous treatment of their very source of knowledge with

condescending expressions (relegated to some footnotes or even endnotes or even none at all) like

"my native informer tells me..."; and as their sinister perversity would inspire them  

to take things to their logical conclusions, promptly rush to patent the same,

and make haste to cry hoarse about intellectual property rights and plagiarism.

Born racists as they are, they will brand even the free dispensers of knowledge as racists,

but promptly package it, brand it with new names, and make it a commercial enterprise.

Looting knowledge systems of other heritages, and making money out of it  

is but their creed and tradition.  

"***te'mI mAnuSha-rAkShasaH para-hitam svArthAya nighnanti ye***"

would only be a mild characterisation of their mean mien and degenerate demeanor.  

  

Yoga and Ayurveda are not the only cases in point.  

(And in order to prove the rule,  

there will be a few exceptions among them, no doubt).
