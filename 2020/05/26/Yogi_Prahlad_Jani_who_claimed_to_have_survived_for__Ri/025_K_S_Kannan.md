You are very right, dear Gargeswari.

  

It is only when one sits in judgement over the other that problems arise.

There are good and bad religionists as well as scientists,

human beings as they basically are.

  

Problems started in the West when the Church tried to scuttle science

and persecute scientists. Science grew skeptical of all religious claims.

There has no been persecution of scientists in India in general.

  

Apparently, the Abrahamic faiths give a license to loot and plunder

all "others", the heathens and the pagans. Western contempt of the East

had its genesis here, and is a continuing legacy yet.

  

This combination of factors - of scientists getting skeptical of all "religious" claims,

and of the West disdaining the East - has led to the current situation of  

scientists irresponsibly dismissing off-hand any claim made by yogi-s,

some of whom did have, and do have, many attainments to their credit.

  

The attitude of the scientists that they can sit in judgement upon everything on earth,

despite costly lessons, is what is hindering a correct and full understanding of the situation.

Scientists poohpoohed yoga and ayurveda for quite some time,

but are ceding space by and by. It is when they speak in an arrogant tone

that they need to be shown their place.

  

There indeed are scientists, though not many in number,  

who are quite serious and unsparing in their investigations,  

yet humble enough to spell out what they know and what they do not.

  

Already towards the end of the 19th Century, scientists had stated (on record)

that there was nothing more to discover. Right in 1974, scientists had claimed that

in a matter of a quarter of a century, computers will understand jokes,  

write poetry, create music, and even interpret Shakespeare etc.  

Today's scientists know where they stand.

  

Better wisdom prevails in the writings of Nobel Laureates such as

Eddington and Schrodinger and others, who speak more responsibly.

There is no need to pay heed to the black sheep among scientists

whose sole goal is to carry on tirades against all Eastern wisdom.
