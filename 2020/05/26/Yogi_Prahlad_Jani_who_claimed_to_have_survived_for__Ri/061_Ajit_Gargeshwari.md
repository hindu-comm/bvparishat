Please donot use words which will offend others. You general observation by using rude language doesnot help much. I stick to what I know. I have a well awisher of mine who has mystical, paranormal and ESP experiences. I donot wish to share as they need not be. He has been blessed by a very prominent sage of our times. This doesnot prove that belief system is correct and believers have more answers than methodical investigation If an event cannot have scientific explanation that never means an event never accrued. I have already clearly mentioned this point
