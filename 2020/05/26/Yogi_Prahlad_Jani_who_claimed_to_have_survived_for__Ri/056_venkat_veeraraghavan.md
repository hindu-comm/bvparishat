Shri Ajit ji

  

It is the personal details that make a thread interesting. If a person keeps gassing on about theory there is very limited utilitarian value to people.

I personally found the anecdote about Shri Paturi Garu's father interesting and rather hopeful that we have certain rather high standards to live up to.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
