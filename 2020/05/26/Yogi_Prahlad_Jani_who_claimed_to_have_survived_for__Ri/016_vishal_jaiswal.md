Dear Venkatji, I truly feel your pain !

I am aware of missing out on the joy of reading indian literature without translation.

  

I am an aspiring polyglot, and I have the rather ambitious goal of covering nine Indian languages (among others) for the above goal. I don't know how practical it will be, given that Sanskrit is the most important among them all for me, and modern life is poor when it comes to time.

  

Besides Sanskrit -

Hindi/Urdu, Gujarati, Marathi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Assamese.

  

I may start a separate thread in the future asking for input on certain aspects in each language as well as language learning strategies from bvp members as I make concrete progress.

  

Vishal
