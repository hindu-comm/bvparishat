Specialists in their subjects will know most of the works published in their area. For yoga bibliography two book i can think off right now.  

-   Yoga An Annotated Bibliography of Works in English 1981-2005 Daren
    Callahan -   Bibliography of Yoga Manik Thakar CASS University of Poona,1995

There are many specialist works which have excellent bibliographies first such works need to be collected and then a comprehensive bibliography can be created.

Most of the works published by Kaivalya dhama are very important books but don't have any bibliography in comprehensive way.

Compiling bibliography on every shastra that literature published in English sanskrit Hindi Regional languages and European languages will be very large project would require a group of scholars to work not sure if Indic Academy will have the resources (they may have its for them to comment) to sponsor a project on such a large and grand scale.
