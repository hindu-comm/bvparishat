Dear Sir

It is not fair to call it a claim after extensive testing and video records.  
They apparently even measured the weight of water before and after bathing.  
Words like extreme adaptation etc show that they had no clue and had to make up names for what was going on.

There are.. were many such paragons. PJ also claimed that he can live on for 5000 years if he so wished but decided not to.  
One thing common with most is they avoid publicity.  
PJ apparently thought otherwise.
