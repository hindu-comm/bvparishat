Siddhis are an impediment to progress is a refrain of people who don't have these.

  

Much nuance is needed to clarify this. It is convenient to say such things when one omits defining what constitutes progress.

Siddhis are a side effect of rise in consciousness and unavoidable just as one who rises high gets to see much farther than others at ground level.

One can choose to keep mum about what one sees but the power of ahamkara fuelled by taposhakti is too much for many to bear.

Siddhis are not meant for exhibition as you rightly say because no self respecting yogi would expose himself/herself for all the gold in the world.

If you visit a casino or youtube self help gurus you will find the con artists the jugglers the glib talkers near the entrance.

The high rollers the whales and the real billionaires keep their mouths tightly shut and live well hidden. The Donald ofcourse is a conspicuous exception.

  

It is like that in yoga as well.

While PJ may have been genuine his disciples are ego driven as most disciples are. This exposing of a yogi must have been their doing.

Also wikipedia is a mishmash of the opinions of n different people with competing opinions.

How much can a wiki entry say about a man's life?
