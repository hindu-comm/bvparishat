Friends,  

I read through the discussion.

The challenge is not to dismiss an event, but to understand it.

The khichri process itself is physical. We have to find ways to simulate it from the basic physiology.

People who dismiss have little to do with yoga as a practice of life.  

There are tasks for new Indian scientists, hopefully we achieve.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
