I am deleting my last post because of a goof up I made.

The sentence:

"The budget for a month is almost 45,000 rupees for grass and fodder."

  

Should read "The budget for grass and fodder for 3 months is Rs 9000 and the budget for the packets of husk (of tur,rice, wheat etc) is almost Rs. 36,000 /month "

  

So for the next 3 months what they currently need is (36000x3) +9000 = *Rs. 117,000*

  

Apologies for any confusion caused.

  

Thanks,

  

Venkat
