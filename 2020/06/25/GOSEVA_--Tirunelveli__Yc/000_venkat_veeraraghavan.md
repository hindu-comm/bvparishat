Dear Vidvans,

  

A friend of mine received a distress call from a lady and her husband who manage a school and attached Goshala (of 20 cows) in Mulaikaraipatti near Tirunelveli in Tamilnadu.

  

They run a school in an area heavily infested with soul vultures involved in conversion and are at present a 2 person bulwark against the disease of the one true whatever.

  

They have 20 cattle of which many cows are pregnant at the moment.

Mrs. Subbulakshmy was telling me that each cow /calf or bull requires specific diet and they cannot subsist on dry hay alone and also need green grass which they buy from nearby fields. They also buy packed tur, rice, wheat husks and husk bags from oil mills to feed the cows.

  

I have attached some photos that she sent me on whatsapp.

  

The budget for a month is almost 45,000 rupees for grass and fodder. Even part of the money will help them go through the crisis. The Goshala is used for supplying milk to a school for free. They just need to tide over the time till rains start. Right now it is summer in Tirunelveli and COVID has not helped at all. Kindly pitch in with whatever you can. You may transfer funds directly to the account in the picture. Kindly pass it on. It's really urgent. Thank you.

  

Contact person: Subbulakshmi [+91 97876 19682](tel:+91%2097876%2019682)

Thanks and Regards,
