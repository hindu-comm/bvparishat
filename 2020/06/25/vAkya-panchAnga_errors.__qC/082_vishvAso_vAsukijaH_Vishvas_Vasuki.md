LOL. No there is no mutual agreement. The ambiguity is deliberate - even the soldiers are not given LAC maps (if such things exist, they're highly secretive and never shared) - they're just given GPS coordinates for their patrol. That's part of the reason for the periodic fights. For example, at Pangong Tso we claim till finger 8 & patrol(led) till finger 6, they claim till finger 2.  

  

By contrast, LOC is (for the most part) a demarcated border, well understood and agreed upon by militaries on either side. Please put in some effort, and educate yourself.

Again LOL. Please tell yourself "No one runs campaigns based on sentiment" till you actually believe it.

Sorry - are you vAlmIki? I may have implied that you are clueless. vAlmIki, unlike you, was a wise sage.

What campaign (not that it is a bad thing)? Exchanging opinions on the "right" time for festivals becomes a campaign?

Sentiments shared with sincere learned Astika people are necessarily different from sentiments shared by general bumpkins.
