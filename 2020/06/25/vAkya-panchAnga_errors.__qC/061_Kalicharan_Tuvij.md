Namaste,

Seeing that this debate has become seasonal, let me reiterate a few points lest some people lose faith in traditional pancanga time scales and system.

1\) no ayanamsha-s are perfect today, but most are good enough.  
2) there does exist the "correct ayanamsha" and if it is not known at large to people then it is for a reason.  
3) a lot of ongoing/past research has shown clear links of monsoons with siderial motions, including 2nd order effects. To supplement pancanga with modern science, however, would take more than the current rent-seeking behaviour of our academia.  
4) yuga-s exist. This wheel rotates simply because in pancanga no two years are same.
