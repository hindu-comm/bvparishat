Dear Shri Venkatesh Murthy,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks indeed for your mail!

\<Full moon day of Chaitra month will be at or close to Chitta Nakshatra

Full moon day of Vaishakha month will be at or close to Visakha Nakshatra

and so on.... full moon day of Magha month will be at or close to Magha Nakshatra

Full moon day of Phalguna will be at or close to Phalguni Nakshatras.

On a lighter vein, there is a saying in Hindi "रात भर लैला मजनून की कहानी सुनायी तो सुबह्पूछते हो कि लैला मजनून की क्या लगती थी"  

There has been a very constructive discussion in this very august forum on the following address about Madhu being equal to Chaitra and so on in all the Vedas and the Vedangas!

<https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/bvparishat/UN7rMR5-Opw/zUDgoM_EAQAJ>
  

There is absolutely no reference in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas that the full moon has to be conjunct Lahiri or Ramana or some other imaginary Chitradivision for the lunar month to be named as Chaitra and so on!

Attachments from the Samaveda, Shatapatha Brahmana, Taittiriya Samhita and other Vedic literature have been appended in that discussion as proofs that even Acharya Sayana treated Madhu=Chaitra without hankering for Chitra nakshatra full moon!  

Right from the Surya Siddhanta to Siddhanta Shiromani, all the siddhantas have advised to start a lunar new year with Madhu---which can only be seasonal---and it is the same Madhu that has been translated as Chaitra whether by Ranganatha of 16th century or by the famous scholar of Varanasi, Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi of early twentieth century!

Similarly, Bhaskaracharya of 12 century also advised to start the lunar new year from seasonal Madhu!

Then again, Vishnu-dharmottara-Purana has been very categorical that Madhu=Chaitra and so on.

Proofs in original are attached in the form of jpeg or pdf.

Then again, I have given references from all the Vedas and Puranas and siddhantas that the Vedic, Pauranic and siddhantic year is seasonal i.e. tropical!

Still you want Chitra-nakshatra full moon for Chaitra which no Veda or Purana or Siddhanta or commentator has advised!

\<I say give up seasons. Why? Because Nakshatras are more important and powerful in our tradition of ancient Rishis.

Therefore Nirayana is victorious over Sayana calendar.\>  

I have never asked that nakshatras should be neglected! *On the other hand, what**I am asking is that they should be treated with the same reverence as in the Vedic lore, without tying and subsuming them to any imaginary Lahiri or some other Rashichakra, as that was never the case with the Vedas and the Vedangas!*

The attachments nakshatra-00 to nakshatra-5 from the Atharva Veda with the commentary of the scholar-extraordinary viz. Acharya Sayana speaks volumes as to how the nakshatras were "vibrating living deities" in the Vedas and not the imaginry 27 Lahiri or Ramana etc. divisions, as the nirayana jyotishis like you would like us to believe!

Respected Venktesh Murthyji, I really fail to understand as to how I can convince people like you thatnirayana is really niraadhar if they do not want to be convinced in spite of all the astronomical and scriptural proofs!  

There is a saying you can take the horse to river, but you cannot make it drink water!

I rest my case, respected Venkatesh Murthyji!  

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
