Oh really? **Take your rAmAyaNa itself**. What caused rAma to go to war against all odds to regain sItA just to tell her to go wherever she likes as soon as he got her? For that matter, what made him go to vanavAsa or stay there even after bharata begged him? A **certain sentiment and pride**.  

  

That piece of paper on which 500 is written - what is its factual value? That of a very common piece of paper, next to nothing. Yet, a billion and more act as if it is a lot more valuable. Why? Because of the shared belief / agreement/ sentiment that it is worth that much.  

  

That imaginary line near Galwan and Pangong Tso - what objective fact says "this side belongs to us, that to you"? Again, it is shared belief/ sentiment that makes us ready to go to war, kill and die for it.  

  

That piece of cloth or that "national" song - but you get the point, I hope.

I am not agnostic to the existence of the Gods or the sacredness of our myths. Just because I say "myth", rather than "fact", I am not saying that is of inferior value and can be dismissed. A wise man said: "Newspapers have officially the right facts, but their interpretations are imaginary – and their choice of facts are arbitrary. They lie with right facts; a novelist says the truth with wrong facts."

  

Sorry to say that your **understanding of myth as fact is childish and devalues it**. Going by that, you likely don't even grok the true intended meanings it is intended to communicate about various matters (including the nature and role of the Gods, ritual and astronomical motifs).

  

Myths are divine, are “like the Gods”, but are obviously not to be taken literally. They contain both commonly understandable declarations about the Gods and mysteries only understood by the wise. It’s paradoxes and uncouth elements mean also to alert us that their words are veils.

  

The great sage Sallustus expressed this well:  
  
  
  “Myths have been used by inspired poets, by the best of philosophers, by those who established the mysteries, and by the Gods themselves in oracles.”  
  “(They) make the Gods well disposed to those who speak of them.”  
  “Now the myths represent the Gods themselves and the goodness of the Gods”  
  “(Myths are) subject always to the distinction of the speakable and the unspeakable, the revealed and the unrevealed, that which is clear and that which is hidden: since, just as the Gods have made the goods of sense common to all, but those of intellect only to the wise, so the myths state the existence of Gods to all, but who and what they are only to those who can understand. … Besides, to wish to teach the whole truth about the Gods to all produces contempt in the foolish, because they cannot understand, and lack of zeal in the good, whereas to conceal the truth by myths prevents the contempt of the foolish, and compels the good to practice philosophy.”  
  “They also represent the activities of the Gods. … Those who make the world are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hephaistos; those who animate it are Demeter, Hera, and Artemis; those who harmonize it are Apollo, Aphrodite, and Hermes; those who watch over it are Hestia, Athena, and Ares. One can see secret suggestions of this in their images. Apollo tunes a lyre; Athena is armed; Aphrodite is naked (because harmony creates beauty, and beauty in things seen is not covered).”  
  “But why have they put in the myths stories of adultery, robbery, father-binding, and all the other absurdity? Is not that perhaps a thing worthy of admiration, done so that by means of the visible absurdity the soul may immediately feel that the words are veils and believe the truth to be a mystery?”  
  “Of myths some are theological, some physical, some psychic, and again some material, and some mixed from these last two.”  
  “May these explanations of the myths find favour in the eyes of the Gods themselves and the souls of those who wrote the myths.”

That **child-like pseudo-respect** is better than brahma-dveSha, so my compliments on that. The reasonable course for those like me is to **trust vAlmIki as a sage** rather than as a mother and pay heed to what he intends to tell the wise in the language of myth. That is true respect.

A classic rejoinder is: Why not send a spaceship to look for a teacup orbiting jupiter? The Gods have given some of us some buddhi and viveka, you see.

This is a bogus claim. "Science" believes no such thing since it is contrary to observation.

I suppose you are referring to the well known case of rAmbhAu svAmI
(<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7ahejYgaVI> ). Yes, there are people (religious and otherwise) who do extraordinary things - touch a live wire and not get electrocuted, resist heat better than others, stay in ice water for crazy amounts of time etc..

  

Anyway, if you think that science not being able to explain all such cases perfectly falsifies "science", your understanding of "science" is as childish as your understanding of "myth".

So, why are you wasting time being keyboard warrior again?

Since I am not an idiot, I will make my choice based on the circumstance and topic.

Not because I haven't seen malpractices in "science"/ "academia" or "religious babaisms", but because that is fits my nature and is the superior course of action in perfect conformity with the views of my ancestors and sages.
