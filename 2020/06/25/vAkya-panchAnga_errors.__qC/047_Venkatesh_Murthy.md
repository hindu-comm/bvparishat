Namaste Sri Kaulji

  

Thank you for the references. It is not just the problem of Chaitra Purnima or Vaishakha Purnima or other Purnimas. Almost all important festivals have a Nakshatra and we have to celebrate them when the Nakshatra is close to the celebration day. Rama Navami is with Punarvasu but actually it may be with Ardra Nakshatra or neighbouring Nakshatra. But we cannot celebrate it with a far away Nakshatra like Revati or Ashwini. You have tried to argue against this saying there is no Rama Janma details available in our texts. But Sri Vishwas has given you references.

  

If you follow the Tropical Panchanga a time will come when you will celebrate Rama Navami on far away Nakshatras like Revati or Purva Bhadra. Similarly we will celebrate other festivals in far away Nakshatras from the prescribed Nakshatras. This is a wrong way of celebration.
