Dear Shri Radhakrishna Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

Thank you for your response!

\<1. The months were in sync withthe season\>

Very true.

\<2. Although the months were lunar (based on the phase of the moon), the year was solar as they added intercalary months as needed\>

The year was solar and seasonal, i. e. tropical. Some mantrasfrom the Rig-Veda like 1/164/11 claim that a year has (360 days and) 720 days+nights.

द्वादशारं नहितज्जराय वर्वर्ति चक्रं परिद्यामृतस्य\| आ पुत्रा अग्ने मिथुनासो अत्र सप्त शत्तानि विंशतिश्च तस्थुः \|\|

It has talked about (a year of) twelve months with 720 days and nights

AitreyaBrahmana 7/17 has repeated the same thing in the following words in a more explicit manner  

त्रीणि वै शतानि षष्टिश्चानूच्यानि यज्ञकामस्यत्रीणि च वै शतानि षष्टिश्च सम्वत्सरस्याहानि तावान् संवत्सरः संवत्सरः प्रजापतिः प्रजापतिर्यज्ञ...सप्त च वै शतानि विंशतिश्च सम्वत्सरस्याहोरात्रास्तावान्संवत्सरः \|\|

"A Samvatsarah has 360 days, Samvatsarahis Prajapatih and a Samvatsarah has 720 days and nights put together". Acharya Sayana has explained these mantras in a detailed manner (Attachment Aitreya-Brahamana-Samvatsarah)

A solar month has thus 30 days each.However, a mean seasonal---tropical--- year has actually about 365.242 days.  
A synodic lunar month has 29.531 days. Twelve such lunar months = 354.372 days. The solar year of the RV and Ai. Br. etc. with 360 days has thus 5.63 days more than the "synodic lunar year" whereas the actual seasonal year has 10.87 days more than the "synodic lunar year".There was thus a mismatch between the solar year and a lunar period of twelve months  
Though an adhika-masa in the form of Samsarpa has been referred to in the Vedic lore several times, but we have no idea as to howthey were "calculated" in those days.

***Vedanga Jyotisha and Adhika-masa:***

The Vedanga Jyotisha, on the other hand, talks of a solar year of 366 days and advises to have two intercalary months in a yuga of five years of 1830 days---almost every two and a half years each.  

In the former case of the Rig-Veda and Aitreya-Brahmana, where a year is said to have 360 days, an adhika-masa (intercalary month) wouldoccur about every5.33 years whereas in the latter case of the VJ itcould occur every 2.75 years.  

The main purpose of adhika-masa was to keep the lunar months aligned to seasonal solar months,unlike what is being done today----to keep the lunar months aligned to''almighty" Lahiri solar months which are neither seasonal nor sidereal!  

\<3. They did not use the Raashi Chakra (the circle of zodiac as we know today) of Makara, Kumbha and so on.\>

Yes. There are/were no Mesha etc. Rashis in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas. However, we find mention of seasonal i.e. troppical Mesha etc. Rashis times without number in the Puranas, known as Panchama Veda.

\< 4. They did not use the concepts of the 27 (or 28) Nakshatras>

Nakshatras have been discussed times without number in the Vedas, sometimes 27 and sometimes 28 including Abhijit. But it is extremely doubtful that during the period of the Rig-Veda and even Yajurveda, 27 equal nakshatra divisions were in use. But in the time of the Vedanga Jyotisha, we find 27 equal nakshatra divisions, starting from Krittika, because the Vernal Equinox was just entering the Krittika equal division, as the longitude of Eta Tauri ---Alcyone---was about 13 degrees in 1400 BCE, the epoch of the VJ. (Attachment VJ year 1399 BC).

However, we find the Krittika nakshatra having been referred to in the Shatapatha Brahmana and other Vedic lore as the first nakshatra. The Shatapatha Brahmana has said in 2/1/2 that whereas the other nakshatras have one or two stars but the Krittika nakshatra has as many as six stars. (Attachment Sh. Br. nakshatraas)

It means that even before 14th century BCE, Vernal Equinox was in Krittika division. It is therefore possible that because of having a larger number of stars than other nakshatras, this nakshatra division was larger than others and that is why Shatapatha Brahmana is categorical that एता ह वै प्राच्यो दिशो न च्यवन्ते \| सर्वाणि ह् वै यानि नक्षत्राणि प्राच्यो दिशश्च्यवन्ते "These stars of Krittika do not move from the East though other nakshatras do so"

Eta Tauri i.e. Alcyone, a star of Pleiades group of Taurus constellation is supposed to be the main star ofKrittika nakshatra as per the Surya Siddhanta etc. and as per Wikipedia,

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcyone_(star)>  

**The main star, Alcyone A, consists of three components, the brightest being a blue-white[B-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification "Stellar classification")[giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_star "Giant star")****similar to many of the other B-type stars in the Pleiades cluster.** It has an[apparent magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apparent_magnitude "Apparent magnitude")of +2.87 ([absolute magnitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_magnitude "Absolute magnitude")= −2.39), and a radius almost 10 times that of the Sun. Its temperature is approximately 13,000[K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelvin "Kelvin")giving it a total[luminosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminosity#In_astronomy "Luminosity")that is 2,400 times solar. The spectral type of B7IIIe indicates that[emission lines are present](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Spectral_peculiarities "Stellar classification")in its[spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_spectrum "Stellar spectrum"). Like many[Be stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be_stars "Be stars"), Alcyone A has a high rotational[velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity "Velocity")of 149km/s, which has created a gaseous disk flung into orbit around the star from its equator.

So Krittika division had certainly more number of stars and that is why the Vernal Equinox was ''hovering" in that division even before the Vedanga Jyotisha of Acharya Lagadha! 

It is, therefore, just possible that becauseof ease of calculation, Acharya Lagadha had resorted to this system of equal divisions, eliminating Abhijit. and starting from Krittika.

\< 5. The months were Madhu, Maadhava .. and not Chaitra, Vaishaakha …>

Yes, Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. names are very late entries in the Vedic lore. There is nothing on record to show that the Vedas talked of Chaitra etc. months in terms of the Full Moon being conjunct Chitra etc. nakshatras. Madhu, Madhava etc. were interchangeable for solar and lunar months! But at the same time, we must put on record that it was extremely difficult for the Vedic seers and even Acharya Lagadha and his successors to determine the exact transit day of the sun from Madhu to Madhava and so on. As such, they had to depend more on lunar tithis for calculating even solar months!

\<6. They celebrated the equinoxes and the solstices at the correct time, not like today when Uttaraayana is celebrated on Makara Sankraanti which happens on January 14 or 15 nowadays.>  

Acharya Lagadha has give exact definitions of the Solstices and Equinoxes in the VJ in the following words:

घर्मवृद्धिरपाम्प्रस्थः क्षपाह्रास उदग्गतौ \|\| दक्षिणेतौ विपर्यस्तौ शन्मुहुर्त्यनेन तु \|\|

"During the sun's northward journey, the day increases by one prastha of water and the night becomes short. During the southward journey, the conditions reverse. The increase of time during an Ayana is equal to six muhurtas."

Thus it is very clear that Acharya Lagadha knew that the day starts increasing from Uttarayana, but he was wrong when he said that it would increase "by one prastha of water" everyday, since the days do not increase uniformly at all. Similarly, his presumption that the days would increase exactly by six muhurtas during an Ayana is also not correct.

Similarly, in the 31st and 33rd mantra of the Rik-Jyotsham he has discussed Vishuvan. But they are not to be determined by calculations but with the help of tithis, that too determined from mean longitudes of the Moon and the sun----which are away by light years from the exact mean longitudes of modern astronomy!

In a nutshell, we can just only bown our heads in reverence to the attempts of Acharya Lagadha and his predecessors who have made such valiant efforts for determining the proper timing for performing sacrifices more than 3500 years back!

We must also realize here that unlike the fictitious "Maya the Mahasura", Acharya Lagadha has not taken the Hindu populaceof Bharatavarsha for a ride by ascribing his knowledge to any ''tapasya and Vardaan of Surya Bhagwan", that too about twenty lakhs of years back!!

\< This is interesting. How did the Vedic people find out when an intercalary month was needed? Did they calculate it in advance? Or did they just add it on the basis of observation of when the equinox arrived? They must have observed the heavens very meticulously for all this. \>  

It was all an approximation! Intercalation has been talked about in the Rigv-Veda, but we do not know how they calculated it! It is only in the VJ where we get some idea as to how it was calculated!  

With the limited resources available in an inhospitable area like Mahapadmasar (Wular-Lake) of 3500 years back, it was impossible to calculate an equinox or solstice properly to even the nearest day, leave alone the nearest hour, much less the nearest minute! That is why we find a solar year of 366 days in the VJ, a solar year of 360 days in the Rigveda and the Aitreya Brahmana etc. Even in the siddhantic period, which started in the early centuries of CE, it was a Herculean task to calculate the VE or Solstice properly and that is why we find the duration of a tropical year of the Surya Siddhanta---(Vernal Equinox to Vernal Equinox) even more than that of a sidereal year by 8 palas!

\< In this context, it may be remarked that the Arabs did not know how to add intercalary months, and they did not want the help of more knowledgeable Jews in this matter.\>

Regarding the Hejira/Islamic calendar, to start with they also followed intercalary months. As there was no information about an ''adhika-masa" of Mecca in other parts of the world and very often, when people went for a Haj, they had to wait for a month or so because an adhika-masa was going on and no religious ceremonies like Haj etc. could be performed then. As such, it was completely eliminated, for the convenience of the common man, and a purely synodic lunar month was resorted to! (Attachment Islamic-calendar-was-intercalary)

\< Was the Vedanga Jyotisha that you mention available at the time of the composition of the Rig Veda, or was it developed much later? \>

No, the VJ is a much later work after the Rigveda, as it is of about 14th/15th century BCE. Since it has informed that it was being calculated for deciding the proper timings of the Vedic rituals (AND NOT FOR PREPARING HOROSCOPESof Vasishitha, Vishvamitra etc. Rishis!) , it means those rituals had been going on for quite some time and a need was felt for preparing a handbook for calculating the beginning/ending timings of tithi, nakshatra, masa (including adhika-masa) ritu etc. for deciding such proper timings!

\< How did the Indian Raashi Chakra arise? Is there any foreign influence in this? The Indian Raashi chakra has striking similarities to the Greek zodiac. Either they borrowed it from India, or we borrowed it from them.>

Regarding the Rashis and their "arrival" in India from the Greeks or vice-versa, I shall discuss it in the next mail!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
