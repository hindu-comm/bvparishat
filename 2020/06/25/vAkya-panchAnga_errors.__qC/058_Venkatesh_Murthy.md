Namaste Sri Kaulji

  

Your argument has this fault.

A=B in the past. But Today A is not equal to B. You are arguing for A today saying B was never supported. This is the problem.

  

Seasonal calendar = Sidereal calendar in the past because in ancient India times Ayanamsha was very small and negligible.

Seasonal Madhu was same as Sidereal Chaitra with full moon at Chitra Nakshatra.

People were celebrating festivals in the right season and right Nakshatra also. Everybody was happy.

  

Now see what has happened. The Ayanamsha has become bigger and not negligible.

Seasonal is not equal to Sidereal.

You are arguing our texts supported only Seasonal months and never Sidereal. This is the problem.

During ancient times there was no big difference between Seasonal and Sidereal. How can you say they supported only Seasonal months?

There is evidence they supported the Nakshatra based Sidereal calendar but you continue to ignore it.

  

The Nirayana Sidereal calendar gives importance to Nakshatras based luni solar calendar.

  

If you depart away from Nakshatras you will celebrate Rama Navami not in Ardra or Punarvasu or Mrugasira but in Revati or Purva Bhadra. That is a tragedy.
