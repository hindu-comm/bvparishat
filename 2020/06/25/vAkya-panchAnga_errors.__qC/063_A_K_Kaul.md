Shri Kalicharan Tuvijji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<3) a lot of ongoing/past research has shown clear links of monsoons with siderial motions, including 2nd order effects. To supplement pancanga with modern science, however, would take more than the current rent-seeking behaviour of our academia.\>

The Vedic, including that of the Panchama-Veda, seasons are the most scientific whereas the nirayana seasons are really niradhar! How and why?

The first and foremost point that we have to bear in mind is that seasons are impervious to precession! Hence they have nothing to do with "sidereal" or even tropical!

Secondly, there were no Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis in the Vedas or the Vedangas, hence there was no sayana-nirayana confusion then!

Vedic months Madhu-cum-Chaitra, Madhava-cum-Vaishakha etc. were aligned to season and their connotation was very impressive to scholars like Acharya Sayana!.

Now the scientific reasons for the Vedic seasons being natural instead of artificial phenomena:

1. It is but natural that on the shortest day of the year viz. the Pauranik and siddhantinc Makar Sankranti/Pongal--December 21---the sun shines for the minimum time.

Hence there is least warmth and maximum cold.

Thus that is the day when Shishir Ritu starts. That is also the day when the sun has the maximum Southern Declination and starts turning north, hence Uttarayan.

It cannot happen on any other day much less on "almighty" Lahiri Pongal-cum-Makar Samkranti!  

It is the real Shishir Samkranti of Kashmir, in fact the whole of Bharat-varsha!!

Vedic names of Tapas and Tapasya of Shishira months are very significant since that is the best time to be confined to indoors and do "Tapasya"!

In Kashmir, this period of two months is (was?) known as "Chilla Kalaan", "Chilla Khurd" and "Chilla Bacha" . "Chilla" means "seclusion, penance" in Persian and "Kalaan" means "the bigger (period)", "Khurd" the "smaller period" and "Bacha" the period when it is going to end!

2\. On Vasant Samapat viz. the Vishuvat, (Vernal Equinox) the day of Pauranik and siddhantic Mesha Sankranti, the day is equal to night, around March 21. The days start becoming longer and nights shorter.

That is why it is neither very hot nor very cold but pleasant and hence the second month of Vasant Ritu. It is the month of Madhava and Acharyn Sayana has defined it beautifully in his commentaries on the Vedas and the Shatapatha Brahmana!

This can never happen on any nirayana Mesha samkranti whether Lahiri or Raman or Yukteshwar or Fagan and so on!

3\. On Dakshinayan day, around June 21, when the sun starts turning south after having maximum northern declination, the day is the longest and hence the sun shines for maximum duration. That is the real Pauranik and siddhantic Karkata Sankranti when Varsha Ritu starts. This cannot happen on any nirayana Karkata Samkranti.

The Vedic names for the two months of Varsha are "Nabhas" and "Nabhasya"! What a beautiful definition of the rainy season!

4. On Sharat Sampat (Autumn Equinox), around September 22, day is again equal to night and nights start becoming longer than days with the result that the rays of the sun start having less and less of scorching power. Thus the second month of Sharat Ritu. The Vedic name of this month is "Urja"---again a beautiful and significant name!

And still we are cribbing that our Vedic seers were not scientific but our "Lahiri scientists" are weather experts!

Anyway, the above is for northern latitudes.

\<4) yuga-s exist. This wheel rotates simply because in pancanga no two years are same.\>

Regarding the duration of Yugas, there is a considerable difference between Aryabhata Yugas and the Surya Siddhanta Yugas.

Both cannot be correct though both may be wrong.

Besides, the homo sapiens have been around for the last less than 200000 years whereas according to the Surya Siddhanta, the Kaliyuga itself has a duration of 432000 years and before that Dwapara Yuga was of 864000 years! On the other hand, as per Aryabhata, een Dwapara-yuga had a duraton of 1080000 years!

Thus Yuga duration is irreconcilable with scientific facts.

The most ironical part is that as per one and the same Aryabhata, Kaliyuga is supposed to have started at midnight of February 17/18, 3102 BCE as per his AryabhataSiddhanta but as per Aryabhatiya of the same Aryabhata he made it start at 6.00 am of Ujjain Mean Time at Ujjain on February 18, 3102 BCE.

Even Aryabhata's contemporaneous Varahamihira was shell shocked to see such an "invention" of Aryabhata as is evident from his Panchasuddhantika XV/20. (Attachment VM Date)

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
