Namaste



In the discussion on \< Vednaga Jyotisha> and \< panchanga use in
practices of current period>, much discussion has taken place.

Ask the question differently: How did the ancient rishi's use this knowledge and how that aspect is being investigated by \< interpretation of Samskruth Terms>.



Here with I am attaching a paper by Researcher Asko Parpola. Title: The Mirror in ancient India : Its ancient use and present relevance in dating texts.



The term under discussion is 'aadarsha'.

The debated point is on the meaning of the term and the split of the term as \< aa- darsha>.

The line of inquiry is on ' Mirror' in vedic times. Why is this important? Mirror, its making, usage clearly establishes a history time line footprint. (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror>).



Therefore the point to explore here is ' Mirror in Vedas' in relation to ' Observation through mirror for astronomical calculations/ observatory usage model'. If one can establish telescope for seeing far away, the complement of it as ' lens' and ' microscope models' can also be researched in samskruth literature of early period.



On the other side, if \<aadarsha> is split as \< aa- darsha> , two word-units, and interpret as ' till the dark moon', the interpretation of text leads to a different conclusion, as the author of the article takes it.



So the question: How to explain \<aadarsha> in vedanga jyotisha context ? We can talk about Stellarium and software as modern tools. Vakya panchanga relies on 'vakya' for calculation of ' observed posiitons and their significance'. The fact stands that these tools did not exist in the historic past to which the texts discussed belong to.



Look forward for schoalrs inputs.
