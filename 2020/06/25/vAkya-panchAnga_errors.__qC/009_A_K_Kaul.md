Dear Shri Vishvas Vasukiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

Shri T V Sivaraman has sent me a mail about Vakya-Panchangas, the relevant excerpts of which are :

Quote

There are several Vakya panchangams in Tamil nadu, the famous being the Pampu (snake) panchangam, Thanigai Panchangam, Sri Rangam Panchangam, Garudan Panchangam, Arcot SitaramaIyer panchangam and so on.

There will invariably be a difference in timings between drik Ganitha and Vakya Panchangam. But they invariably take the Drik calculation to show correct timings of eclipses (so that they make believe their system is ancient and also accurate).

Some of them, especially Arcot Sita Rama Iyer panchangam, make some predictions about weather and politics that have proved accurate. May be a case of making correct predictions from wrong data. The attached will show their predictions.

I do not understand or believe in Vakya (actually I do not know it). As we progress we have to discard theold systems for a better and accurate one. There is no need for hanging on the old. Of course they were admirable in those days when there were no means of calculating these accurately. Only approximation. But when it is possible now we need not cling on them.

Unquote

He has also sent me the information about "Vakya-Panchanga" predictions being true and also the details about Panchanga. Both these papers are attached.

Regarding Shri Sivaraman's view about "correct predictions from incorrect data", I recall as to howseveral decades back people would throng to my maternal grandpa for knowing their future and also remedial measures for their problems!

And I do not remember even a single person who seems to have been dissatisfied either with the predictions or the remedial measures like "Gayatri mantra Japa", "Maha-mrityunjayana Mantra japa" or "Bhavani Sahasra-nama recitation" , "Acharya Abhinavgupta Stotra recitation" etc. etc.! Sometimes he would advise to have '*pradakshina"* of "Hari-Parbhat" continuously for forty days in the early morning!

He never charged anything either in cash or kind from anybody, as his requirements were fulfilled through his salary as Samskrit teacher in a college in Kashmir.

Very late in the day I realized that the horoscopesthat my grand-father prepared were from the same "Panchang" of Kashmir that was prepared from either Graha-Laghava or Makaranda or Khanda-khadyaka! None of those astronomical handbooks had any semblance of being correct vis-a-vis modern astronomy---they were absolutely meaningless and wrong!

Not so surprisingly, he had made quite a few predictions about my horoscope, which proved correct cent-per-cent, but ironically, he had never predicted that I would take up cudgels againstthe gamut of *niraadhar niraayana* festivals and fasts and muhurtas!

So it was really a matter of "correct predictions from incorrect data"!

As compared to the same, when I was in astrology, I had made some correct predictionsOF MUNDANE ASTROLOGY from an out and out Western system---Secondary progressions and Tropical Rashis, for which I was awarded NOSTRADAMUS AWARD by Express Star Teller!

Similarly, some KP astrologers claimed that they could even predict the timing of "a trunk call maturing" in the days of yore when having a landline was a rare luxury!  

That means that making correct predictions depends more on our ''sixth sense"---(intuition), selfless-services and above all our faith in Him !

But the main crux of this point right now is as to the real days of our fasts, fairs and muhurtas, vis-a-vis at least half-a-dozenayanamshas floating around!

We have to sift grain from the chaff! The earlier the better, since we cannot be an ostrichhidingour neck under the sands on seeing a cat!

शुभस्य शीघ्रं

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
