Namaste

  

But his logic is correct. If Nakshatras are totally neglected like Sri Kaul is saying there will be no basis for astrology predictions at all.

  

Why he neglects Nakshatras and only takes seasons I dont understand. Nakshatras are important. In our Vedas there is great importance given to Nakshatras. As a matter of fact Vidwan RN Iyengar of this group said for ancients Nakshatras are more important than Grahas even. There is Nakshatra Ishti and other important Yajnas in the Vedas

  

If you follow Tropical Panchanga of Kaul you will be celebrating all festivals in wrong Nakshatras. Why will anyone do that?
