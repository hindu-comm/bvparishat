The gentleman predicted that Trump would loose. Prompltly deleted his FB post as soon as someone reminded him of his "prediction" after Trump won. Thankfully this prediction about Tibetan independence in the next 10 years is on video - <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKpPaKIvN5c&feature=youtu.be> .

It would be better if shrI PVR narasimha rAv were more famous for his excellent role in spreading homa rituals.
