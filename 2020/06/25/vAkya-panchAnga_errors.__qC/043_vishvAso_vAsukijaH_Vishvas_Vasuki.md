This is a very significant observation. Whenever the full moon is at chitrA, it necessarily follows that the navamI moon would have been near punarvasU. Hence, it follows that it was a misunderstanding on my part to think that festivals are being celebrated based on naxatra-s with an offset ayanAMsha (thence falsifying the conclusion that current festival observation does not entail star cluster primacy). This misunderstanding was due to the thought that "Lahiri ayanAMsha" entailed shifting the naxatra-s from the corresponding star clusters. I will study and try to understand the Calendar reform committee report better - <https://archive.org/details/calendar_reform_comittee_report> .  
  

The above should have been Venkatesh Murthy's response in the first place, rather than ("I don't need to go and see the stars, moon is in my mind etc.."). Any, thanks for pointing out my error (even if it was unintentional).
