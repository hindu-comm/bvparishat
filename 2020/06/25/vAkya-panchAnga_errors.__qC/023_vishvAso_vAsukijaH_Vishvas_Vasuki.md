Following naxatra-s only is actually respectable in certain cases
("यत्पुण्य॒न्नक्ष॑त्रम्, तद्बट्कु॑र्वीतोपव्यु॒षम्") - if so, it's probably best to do nirayana properly, not do any drama about correcting for drift, take ayanAMsha offset to be zero. Atleast that way people honor the naxatra-s rather than sheer confusion.
