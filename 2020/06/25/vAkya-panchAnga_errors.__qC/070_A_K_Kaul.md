Dear Shri Vishvas Vasuki,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< It turns out that all the siderial vs tropical arguments have already happened long time ago.>

Pl. go through "Chitra-janmpatri" that I have sent as an attachment.

There is a thorough discussion about nirayana versus Sayana by the one and only S B Dikshit in his "History of Indian Astronomy" and "Chitra Janmapatri" is a part of the same.

Poor Dikshit had to stop a Sayana Panchanga that was started by him and some of his colleagues more than a hundred years back because it scared the nirayana loyalists!

I had been publishing "Shri Krishna Universal Ephemeris and Panchang" for about ten years and though it contained nirayana (of course, the "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha) as well Sayana longitudesof planets to please "Lahiri Jyotishis" but most of them boycotted it and I had to stop it ultimately!

Shri Darshaney Lokesh and Shri T V Sivaraman are now publishing their Sayana panchangas against all odds and I am trying my best that they should continue it so that maybe the general public will ultimately start following dharma as against nirayana Adharma, as pointed out by the "Report of Calendar Reform Committee".

The CRC had advised to switch over to the seasonal calendar, and they had hoped that the Hindus of Bharatavarsha would do so sooner than later (attachment "CRC Recommendation"), but in vain!

In any case, I have faith in Him and will continue to propagate the Vedic Calendar instead of the anti-Vedic nirayana one!

Never say die!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
