I am collecting vAkya-panchAnga errors such the below recent one in my notes at <https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/jyotisham/history/errors/> :

  

\- June 21 2020 was a special day - it was the solstice day, there was an annular solar eclipse visible from India (with peak at 11:47:35 am IST), and it naturally was amAvAsyA until 11:47:35 am IST. vAkya-panchAnga-s had obvious errors with regards to sun-moon conjunction (and consequently eclipse and end of amAvAsyA) - so tithi junction was till 12:30 or so. Some ritualists simply followed pop culture and used more accurate dRk-panchAnga-s for eclipse observances; while following vAkya-panchanga regarding parva-rituals! Such inconsistency! So, they incorrectly conducted sthAlIpAka the following day. (Not to mention, they must have continued saying "uttarAyaNe" in their sankalpa-s as well.)

  
  

Besides the above and the like (wrong conjunctions involving other graha-s like budha, guru etc..), **what other classes of errors do vAkya-panchAnga-s make**?
