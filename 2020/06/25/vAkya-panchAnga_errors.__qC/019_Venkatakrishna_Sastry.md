Namaste



It gives a feeling of sadness going through some of the 'bold
statements', in this thread on ' Errors- Pachanga' and 'Vedanga Jyotisha ( also Known as Jyotir-Yoga and Jyotir-vijnana) in tradition. 

Kaul has regurgitated his position enough times . And does not seem to get the essence of what VJ is for. Panchanga is only a handy tool, like the chart for predictions.



Regarding Vakya-Pachanga perceived errors, one needs to see why 'Vara-ruchi' - the Vartika-kaara on Panini provides the 'Vakya authority', How are we understanding the 'kaalarthaka taddhitas ' in Panini and guidance is provided for their use in ' mantra yoga -shastra' towards which 'Vakya- jyotisha practice' is aligned to. The integral connection of Samskrutham- Yoga and Jyotisha as a part of Vedanga is the backdrop of ' Vakya-paddhati'. 



To understand 'Vakya' one needs to understand 'Vak'. In Vakya -siddhanta frame work this is called starting with the 'swara shaastra ( breath, sound and Prana) '. The Panchanga points to time cycles connected with thought becoming talk, a prashna for further analysis. This is a specific model of using 'Chandra' at the time of ' prashna', as is done in 'ashta-mangala prashna, kerala paddhati' etc;.



Without a totla clarity on this whole integration, how can we take a generic statement that 'Vakya' panchanga has errors ? If there are human erros of omission and commisison, calcualtion, well they need to be sorted out. 



The sadness is due to several factors, mainly on good, serious, academic and interested scholars using most inappropriate and ' unscientiifc constructs' in deliberating the subject.

I do not know whether they have been 'taught the discipline with partial blinkers' or ' developed their perception about the discipline in a preferential way' in making the statements . 

I am also not sure how many of these 'research-commentators' would
get a ' pass criterion' to be called practitioners of 'Vednaga Jyotisha' before airing their claims on ' Vedanga Jyotisha errors' discovered through research'.



I submit a small note below before pushing the question : What is the method by which study, practice and research in Vedanga-Jyotisha' is
made to discover these errors ?

Does the researcher stand the test of audit
by the tradition given by by Maharshi Parashara, Jaimini, Varahamihira and eighteen other 'siddhanta' schools ?



Pushing the social shortocmings in the practice of VJ , certainly needs correction. Hype needs to be cut. Yes, it is a need and we have to address together.

Vedanga Jyotisha Educaiton needs a relook from its current model of ' Veda -sanitized, Astronomy anchored software generated tabulation, used for social sooth saying and prescribing costly remedial meausres in the name of 'vedic remedies. ' . The feeling can only be expressed requoting Kaul \< There is a saying in Punjabi तन नहीं बिगड़ी है ताना ही बिगडा है >



And this reform needs to begin by a revisit on VJ syllabus formation:
' How and How much VJ- researcher needs the knowledge of Yoga and Samskrutham, the prequalification requisite for a ' Jyotishi' mentioned in some earlier post by professor Korada.



***A brief note on Vedanga Jyotisha (VJ) basics, Basic axioms which are not inappropriately addresed in modern claimed research on VJ, projecting errors of 'They' ( the ancient Rushi's)***



1. Basic Axioms in Vedanga Jyotisha: Kaala ( Modern material, biological, space and statistical scineces have no common vision or clarity. Therefore the primary need is to get the basics right).



 1a. Kaala ( TIME): Kaala is 'Conscious'. Kaala is
manifest form of Supreme Divine. Kaala has impact on ' Life -events ( good, bad, neutral)' by individual and contextual specificity.



 1b. Kaala (TIME) Measure ( Ganita, Maana, Division) : There are multiple scales of Kaala. The 'Ho-Ra' is one model of time measure for human activity convenience.

Ho-Ra is locked to the 'day-night cycle' experienced at given locale (desha). Ho-Ra change-measure is only a small segment of ' Kaala-Maana'.



 The kaala scale of measure extends on both sides of ' ghati- vighati' count model to a huge scale of 'yugas' and miniaturised model in nano scales, related to ' praana-sookshmataa'.



 Constricting this vast scale and vision of Kaala-maana to the earth-scale of Gregorian calendar and a few thousand years ( around five thousand years ?? ) is like seeing elephant in the mirror.

 Even the scpetic thinker needs to explain what part of the gregorian calendar time scale would fit in the measure of ' Ho-Ra' mentioned in Gita (8-17) :

 sahasra-yuga-paryantam, ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ ; rātriṁ yuga-sahasrāntāṁ te 'ho-rātra-vido janāḥ. Is this ' Ho-Ra' refering to 24 hour cycle ??



 The scales of time meausre used in Science by quartz clock frequency oscillation is only a partial segment map of VJ- Kaala-Maana.

 The ' bhashaa-samskruth terms' in kaala-varga of amara kosha are for observed phenomenon (vyavahara) here on earth and in a given locale.



 The 'Vedic term (Chandas) for Kaala are by sensing the ' Time- Motion' which goes to the speeds beyond the speed of light.




 Do we have people, measure units, research capabiliites to get in to ths range of study ? Can Hubble telescope and space research probes help in VJ research ?

This would need a deliberation between ' Astrophysicists, Space scientists and VJ researchers'.



 Using a NASA program to give a software plotting the sky map of solar system with stellar backdrop is a good and useful tool. But that is not enough for VJ Research.

 Sri Narasimha rao ( and many others) have provided very useful tools that take off the calculation strain on practicing astrologers and quick solution seeking clients. There is more to be explored.



 1c. Kaala (TIME) impacts, transforms and consumes Matter( Bhoota- Drvaya) , Energy (Shakti) and ' Life( Jeevi). In science, this dimesnion of TIME is not considered. 





2. Basic Axioms in Vedanga Jyotisha: Karma (Destiny) ( Modern psychological, biological, social and statistical scineces have no common vision or clarity . The primary need is to get the basics right).

 In VJ, the study is how Kaala is to be used for planning action (karma- samskara) benefit for freedom from suffering, maximising the comfort, improving the relations et al ( the 12 bhavas)

 For this purpose, the Kaala-swaroopa template used in Graha- Nakshatra - Mandala. The distance of sun, Moon, grahas and nakshatras from earth ( Bhoo-kendra) is known to VJ.

Each element in the template here exerts a different force ( pra-bhaava, kaarakatva) on individual'( jeeva)'. 



3. Basic Axiom: Phala ( Utility benefit). Branched Disciplines are built in VJ using these axioms to give phala pointers. Eg.
Parashari, Jaimini, Naadi et al ( 18 systems ), their sub -disicplines, practice. 



 The entirety of VJ disciplines have evolved using the basic axioms of VJ to deliver disicplines which serve different needs of
human socieites for comfort and spiritual seeking.

Each discipline uses its own measure and model ( Ganita- Siddhanta) derivatives from basic axioms. They are disicpline specific needs. They are not violative of basics or the ultimate goals.



 For example, Vakya practitioners have their anchor to vararuchi -Vakyas ; practice prevalent in south India. Vakya-Panchanga is their reference table.

If the client has no pain that is addresed in 'vakya'
system' there is no need to go after that disicpline. May be Nirayana, Barhaspatya models work.



 If beyond India, like South asia, the rahu-ketu based systems of calculation ( Dragon math model) would be useful.



 If one is a yogi seeking ' good muhurtha for sadhana', the naadi level calculation may be needed.

 **In this sense, VJ is anushaasanam. It is NOT off the shelf product.** Certainly NOT the 'mechanized chart production, divisional charts, dasha-bhukti segmenting, and text-segment quoting for 'phala'.



 The rule is फलानि ग्रहचारेण सूचयन्ति मनीषिणः 'Phala' is ' viisoned, divined, pointed to ( not committed)' by the ' daivajna- kaalajna- mauhoortika- kaartaantika ( one who knows the final result of the

action).

It is seeing through the veil of TIME-ACTION -DEATH TRANSITIONS ' Kaala-Karma- Mrutyu' as Gita (4-5) says :

sri-bhagavan uvaca- bahuni me vyatitani, janmani tava carjuna, tany aham veda sarvani, na tvam vettha parantapa

 

This is 12th house :Mode of Death (nidhana) connected to
first house Birth / Re-Birth (janma).



 Science is yet to provide a way of seeing beyond current moment to the past or the future. In science, Past analysis is DATA analyisis (Event over). Future analysis is logical trending. It is NOT visioning.
