Superficial followers of this reasoning should consider the following:

  

\- Do they see the moon (representing the gem of yadu branch of chandravamsha) rise at midnight (which happens naturally during aShTamI) at rohiNI (ie Aldebran aka alpha Tauri, appropriately in the bovine constellation)?

\- Do they look at the sky on rAmanavamI and observe the moon at punarvasU (never mind further inferences about the diametrically opposite dhanur rAshi, shravaNa trio along the celestial river near dhaniShThA etc..)?

\- Do they celebrate the sacred day of kArttikeya when the ShaShTI moon is with the kRttikA-s (Pleiades), roughly opposite in the naxatra-chakra to the place of his brother vishAkha, not far from where semen of his father fell into the celestial river and grew along the "sharavaNa" (all identifiable in the night sky)?  

  

If the answer is no, they should ask themselves who they're kidding with their naxatra identifications.
