I am not Mr Kaul, but writing my answer anyway:

  

I believe that the scientific theories about the origin of our species is pretty accurate (far more so than other alternatives). I take it that you are averse to such theories?  

rAma may be part historical, part myth - but whatever the proportion,
the rAmAyaNa is a divine work, rAma is an avatAra, and we still love and care about him - hence we want to celebrate his festival at the most aesthetically appropriate time; we want his mandir in the place of the demolished rAxasAlaya etc.. It is a more matter of sentiment than fact.
