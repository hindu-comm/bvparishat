Namaste Sri Kaulji

  

There is a big problem in Sayana method of considering only seasons. If you do that you will celebrate Rama Navami in the correct season Spring but what happens to Nakshatra. You may celebrate it not in Rama's Janma Nakshatra Punarvasu but in some other constellation like Revati. If you are celebrating Rama's birth in Revati it is totally against our tradition.

  

Same thing will happen for Krishna Janmashtami. You may correctly celebrate it in rainy season. But it may be in Uttara Bhadra instead of Rohini or Mrugasira. If you are celebrating Krishna Janma in such Nakshatras it is totally against our tradition. Why don't you see this?

  

To protect the seasons you are making a big error in Nakshatras. Why this is acceptable?
