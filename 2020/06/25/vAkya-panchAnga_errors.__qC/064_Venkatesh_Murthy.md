I mean when the Surya Siddhanta was being used in ancient times the Ayanamsha was small. Now the difference between Sayana and Nirayana is 22 days but in those days it was a few days only. Therefore there was no problem if the festivals were late by a few days and on or close to the correct Nakshatras.
