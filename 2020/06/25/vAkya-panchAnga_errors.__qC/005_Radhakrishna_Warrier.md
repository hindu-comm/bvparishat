Avtar Kaul ji, your posts are quite interesting.

  

So, as I understand it, you are saying that, in the Vedic age:

  

1. The months were in sync withthe season

2. Although the months were lunar (based on the phase of the moon), the year was solar as they added intercalary months as needed

3. They did not use the Raashi Chakra (the circle of zodiac as we know today) of Makara, Kumbha and so on.

4. They did not use the concepts of the 27 (or 28) Nakshatras

5. The months were Madhu, Maadhava .. and not Chaitra, Vaishaakha …

6. They celebrated the equinoxes and the solstices at the correct time, not like today when Uttaraayana is celebrated on Makara Sankraanti which happens on January 14 or 15 nowadays.

  

This is interesting. How did the Vedic people find out when an intercalary month was needed? Did they calculate it in advance? Or did they just add it on the basis of observation of when the equinox arrived? They must have observed the heavens very meticulously for all this. In this context, it may be remarked that the Arabs did not know how to add intercalary months, and they did not want the help of more knowledgeable Jews in this matter. So, the Islamic year (the Hijra year) is short by a few day and the months cycle through the seasons.

  

Was the Vedanga Jyotisha that you mention available at the time of the composition of the Rig Veda, or was it developed much later? How did the Indian Raashi Chakra arise? Is there any foreign influence in this? The Indian Raashi chakra has striking similarities to the Greek zodiac. Either they borrowed it from India, or we borrowed it from them.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
