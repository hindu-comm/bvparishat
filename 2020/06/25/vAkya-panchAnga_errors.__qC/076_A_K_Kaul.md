Dear Shri Radhakrishna Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<My question is about pre-modern Indian astronomers following astronomical systems based on different ancient Indian astronomical works. Could they, and did they predict correctly astronomical events like lunar and solar eclipses, conjunctions of heavenly bodies, etc.?
Are there records of these astronomers predicting these events correctly?\>

1. If even a single event like eclipse, Saturn tormenting Rohini, Mars retrograde in Magha and so on (attachment Mahabharata bh-graha-yutih) had been based on astronomy the date of the Mahabharata war could have been arrived at least about a couple of centuries back when modern astronomical works like Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, Lunar Tables of Brown or Ross corrections for Mars and Tables of Planetary longitudes etc. had been created!

But even after more than two centuries of modern astronomy and even with the latest satellite algorithms from JPL/NASA and tempting software like Planetarium, Stellarium, Swiss Ephemeris, Astrolog and what not we have not progressed even by a single inch in that direction!

Similarly we are still wondering whether the Mahabharata war took place in the early centuries of the first millennium BCE or in 5561 BCE!

2. Similarly, if the planetary position of Bhagwan Ram's horoscope had been the real ones, His date of birth would have been arrived at several decades back.

On the other hand, if we are told that Bhagwan Ram had ruled for 11000 years we feel at a loss as to how to react to such a statements!

Similarly, if the same Valmiki Ramayana tells us that after having ruled for sixty thousand years, soothsayers were telling Dashrath अवष्टब्धँ च मे नक्षत्रँ दारुणैर्ग्रहै and so on we really get confused as to how and when could that have happened!

3. Then again, the most adored astronomical work of india viz. the Surya Siddhanta, claims that it was revealed to Maya Mahasura by none other than Surya Bhagwan Himself, that too a couple of million years back, which means the planetary longitudes obtained from that work should have been an envy of today's JPL/NASA, but I am sorry to say that it has created the worst possible problems for the credulous Hindu majority of Bharatvarsh because it's longitudes are not correct for any year except for Shaka 444 and may be a century plus or minus to the same at the most!

And out of our श्रद्धा (reverence) for Surya Bhagwan we never questioned it's credentials!

4. Leave alone the "Maya Mahasura" , "Surya Bhagwan" and Aryabhata of yore, as late as early twentieth century, the redoubtable siddhantic Indian astronomer viz. Chandrashekhar Samant also known as Pathani Samant trashed Aryabhata's statements that the earth was rotating on its axis!

Galelio of Galilei is supposed to have faced "Inquisition" from the "Church" in the sixteenth century for believing the earth revolved round the sun and if Pathania Samant had it within his powers he also would have launched a similar Inquisition about Aryabhata.

It is very interesting to know as to why Pathani Samant chided Aryabhata! For the simple reason that his statement was in conflict with the Surya Siddhanta and the Puranas!

All this will be clear from the attachments SD1, SD2 and so on!

In fact, even today an institution like the world famous Banaras Hindu University is publishing its Vishva Panchang based on the Makaranda/Surya Siddhanta and boasting to the whole world as to how modern it is! But at the same time, it is getting the details for eclipses etc. from PAC, Kolkatta!

Then we have some Sampradayas of revered Jagadgurus also sailing in the same boat!

It leaves me very sad, really, to have to express such unpleasant truths.

And that is why I am unable to reconcile with the admonishment of the Law giver Manu

सत्यँ ब्रूयात् प्रियँ ब्रूयात्न ब्रूयात् सत्यमप्रियँ। असत्यँ च प्रियँ न ब्रूयात्, एष धर्मः सनातनः।।

With kind regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
