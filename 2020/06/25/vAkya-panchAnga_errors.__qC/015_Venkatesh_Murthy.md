Namaste

  

The most famous astrologer today is with no doubt Sri PVR Narasimha Rao. He has predicted correctly major events.

  

See what he says -

'However, zodiacal signs are supposed to be aligned to nakshatras, which correspond to constellations of stars in the sky. For example, the sign of Aries should contain Aswini nakshatra, Bharani nakshatra and a part of Krittika nakshatra. If we use the tropical zodiac, signs will slowly shift with time and point to different nakshatras in different eras. This is totally inconsistent with the teachings of rishis.'

  

Therefore he is following the Nirayana System based on Nakshatras only and not Sri AK Kaul's Tropical Panchanga. Sri AK Kaul's saying Nirayana is Niraadhaar itself is Niraadhaar.
