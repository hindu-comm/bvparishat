You present one data point and produce the exact opposite conclusion!

  

Equinoctial point was exiting (not entering or hovering!) kRttikA and approaching bharaNI then, sir! (Please see this [2300BCE](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/jyotisham/naxatram/images//bce-2300-01-13_kRttikA_anUrAdhAH_equinox_dhaniShThA-shatabhiShak_maghA_solstice.png) and this [1400BCE](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/jyotisham/naxatram/images//bce-1400-01-13_bharaNi-3deg_vishAkhA_equinox_dhaniShTha_AshreShA-maghA_solstice.png) image - lower right corner arrows) Later still, it entered ashvinI. Also if you look at kRttikA in the night sky, these 6 stars are very closely clustered together - so it is very doubtful that they would justify giving kRttikA division excess width.  

Given that Vedāñga Jyotiṣa states that the summer solstice began in the middle of आश्लेषाः (see bottom left arrows in [1400BCE](https://vvasuki.github.io/saMskAra/jyotisham/naxatram/images//bce-1400-01-13_bharaNi-3deg_vishAkhA_equinox_dhaniShTha_AshreShA-maghA_solstice.png) image and extrapolate to 1300BCE when that happened), it hardly makes sense to claim that lagadha placed equinox in kRttikA.
