Dear Shri Venkat Veeraraghavan,

Jai Shri Ram!

You had "court-marshalled" me for having a skeptical view about the long duration of the yugas in my original mail.

In response to the same, I asked you a simple question as to in which TretayugaBhagwan Ram had Incarnated according to you:

\(1\) whether it wasAryabhata Tretayuga which ended around 1087500 years back or

\(2\) the SS Tretayugawhich ended only 870000 years back, and then again, whether

\(3\) you would go by the "mid-night-starting" Kaliyuga of Aryabhata or

(4) "the sunrise starting Kaliyuga" of the same Aryabhata and why!

I have yet to hear from you about the same!

\<am frankly not interested in Shri Nilesh Oak's position since I think Dr. Manish Pandit has effectively disproved his MB war dates with quotes from the text.>

It is not about Shri Nilesh Oak or Dr. Manish Pandit! On the other hand, we have more than 60 per cent of the scholars who have concluded the date of the Mahabharata war to be much later than the date of Kaliyuga viz. 3102 BCE. It is only Shri Nilesh Oak who says it took place about 2000 years before Kaliyuga. In fact, he had followed in the footsteps of late Dr. P V Vartak, since he also had arrived at a similar conclusion i.e 5561 BCE!

Similarly, no scholar has attempted till date to calculate the year ofBhagwan Ram's Incarnationas per the long yuga theory. Shri Vinay Jha is no exception in spite of the fact that he is a very great Scholar of scriptures and a high class Surya Siddhanta software engineer.

In fact, we are just making a fool of ourselves since on the one hand, we believe in the yuga theory of the Surya Siddhanta and even Aryabhatiya, who claim to be able to calculate planetary longitudes for any epoch from the dawn of present Kalpa to its end, but when it comes to calculating the dates of any events whether past or present or future, we always sayनासा शरणं गच्छामि

\<There has to be alignment between sankalpa and agenda.>

The word "samkalpa" reminds me that we recite the daily "samkalpa" about Kalpa, Manvantara, Yuga, varsha etc. as per the Surya Siddhanta (instead of Aryabhatiya!!) but do not calculate even our horoscopesfrom the same work ! How ironical it is!

\<This was clearly brought out by the case of Shri Madhusudhan Sarasvati writing Advaita Siddhi while desiring the darshan of Lord Krishna.

The great man had significant issues with mantra siddhi even after even 17 purascharanas.\>

I do not have any mantra-sidhih nor am I trying for one! On the other hand, I keep on asking :

जनास्त्वत्पादाब्ज श्रवण मनन ध्यान निपुणाः \| स्वयं ते निस्तीर्णाः न खलु करुणा तेषु करुणा \|\|

भवे लीने दीने मयि मनन हीने न करुणा \| कथं नाथ ख्यातस्त्वामसि करुणा सागरिति \|\|

This is something like what Umar Khayyam, the famous Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer of 11th century Khorasan (now Iran), is supposed to have said:

नेक किरदारों के सदके देदेना नजात \| मेरे माबूद मैं असियान के लिए हूँ सौगात \|

गिन के चन्दनेकियाँ नेकों मैं ही करलेनाशुमार \| यूँ अगर बदऐमाली पे भी भख्शे तो है कौन सी बात \|

( असियान के सौगात = गुनाहों की पोटली; बदऐमाली = बुरे कर्म)\|

\<I think there is a lesson in there for all of us.>

In an academic discussion, there is nothing personal! I have joined this august forum to learn from it and honestly, I have learnt a lot during my association with the same!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
