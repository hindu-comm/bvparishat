Sri Venkatesh Murthy ji

  

You can solve your problem and correct your misreadings by actually checking in a panchanga the monthly rise and fall of nakshatras along with tithis in the course of the month.

  

This will help you realise that your premises are all wrong.

It will also stop the cornucopia of verbiage on this thread and give peace to all.

  

Regards

  

V
