Dear Shri Venkat Veeraraghavanji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< And please understand Rama lived in Tretha Yuga and the Yuga calculations throw the date much much before the date you have quoted.>

As per Aryabhata, Tretayuga ended 2020+3101 (years of Kaliyuga)+ 1080000 years of Dwapara Yuga i.e. 1085121 years back.

According to the Surya Siddhanta, Tretayuga ended 2020+3101 (years of Kaliyuga)+ 864000 years of Dwaparayuga i.e. 869121 years back.

But the earliest date of "Rama Ravana Yuddha" claimed by present scholars is 12209 BCE as per Nilesh Oak, 7323 BCE as year of Incarnation as per late Dr. P V Vartak and January 14, 5114 BCE as per late Pushkar Bhatnagar!

In any case, your view that Bhagwan Ram had incarnated either about 1085000 or about 869000 years back is in agreement with the Pauranic lore that the yugas have very long duration. My grandfather, my father and even I myself had a similar view till a few decades back .

The Valmiki Ramayana that we have around these days is supposed to have been "compiled" by the same Maharshi Valmiki who was a contemporary of Bhagwan Ram!

It is just not possible that it could have been written so many years back since the homo sapiens have been around for not more than 200000 years as per

<https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens>

If it is just a matter of faith, I have nothing to say and I just respect your views.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
