You cannot deny this fact. If you go with Tropical Sayana Calendar there will be a gap between Tropical and Sidereal calendars. This gap will become bigger and bigger as time passes. This will create a bigger and bigger difference in Nakshatras of festivals. Why? Because of Precession. Nakshatras are sidereal. Not Tropical. They cannot change with Seasons.

Result will be you can enjoy festivals in the correct season but the Nakshatras will be different from our ancient Rishis recommendations.

  

You can worship Rama and Krishna and other gods in the right season but the blessings of Nakshatras will not be on you.

This is against the spirit of Shastra and actually it is more like Western System. The Western people do not have any respect for Nakshatras.
