Linguistically, that's what the term chaitra means - please see pANini's sUtra with commentaries: <https://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/sk1223>  

Generally agree with you as did the calendar committee members, but this system at least (mostly) ensures that many festivals can be celebrated with correct asterism-moon conjunction. So, it has some limited utility.
