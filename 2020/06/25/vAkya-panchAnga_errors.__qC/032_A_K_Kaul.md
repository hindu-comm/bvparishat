Dear Shri Vishvas Vasuki,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<**Nirayana* years make doubtful even the moksha (liberation) of its followers:*

  

So much masaala :-) Your quote makes no such suggestion.\>

It appears you have missed the quote

*Chahandogya Upanishad*(a part of*SamavediyaTalwakar Braman*) says in 4/15/5

‘‘अथ यदु चैवास्मिंछव्यं कुर्वन्ति यदि च नार्चिषमेवाभिसंभवन्त्यर्चिषोअहरह्न आपूर्यमाणपक्षाद्यान् षडुदङ्ङ्ेति मासांस्तान्मासेभ्यः संवत्सरं संवत्सरादादित्यमादित्याच्चन्द्रमसं चन्द्रमसो विद्युतं तत्पुरुषोऽमानवः स एनान्ब्रह्मगमयत्यिेष देवपथो ब्रह्मपथ एतेन प्रतिपद्यमाना इमं मानवम्नावर्तंत नावर्तन्ते नावर्तन्ते।।‘‘

I had given a Hindi tranlation of the same also so that it can be understood conveniently!

I am also sure you have read the Bhagvadgitawhich states in 8/24

अग्निर्ज्योतिरहः शुक्लःषण्मासाः उत्तरायणम \| तत्रप्रयाता गछन्ति ब्रह्मब्रह्मविदो जनाः\|\|

Naturally, the six months of Uttarayana that Bhagwan Krishna is talking about cannot take place in Lahiri or Pushya-Pakshya etc. solar years or even Rashichakras!

You must also have heard about Bishma waiting for Uttarayana for shedding off his mortal coil, as he did not want to be reborn.

Since there was no Lahiri Ayanamsha or "Pushya-Pakshjya" etc. Ayanamsha then, naturally, Bhishma was waiting for the real Uttarayana, that can take place in only a seasonal i.e. tropical year!

\<To sum up, the new solar year that we are supposed to celebrate around April 14/15 every year is not related to any of the four cardinal points viz. the two equinoxes and two solstices. Nor is it related to any season. All it is related to is the "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha!

Fine, but you still haven't shown why it is not sideria\>  

1. Would you be kind enoughto quote even as single mantra from the Vedic lore, a single shloka from any of the Puranas or a single shloka from any siddhanta which has advised us to celebrate a "Mesha Samkranti" when the days and nights or not equal.  

(Since it is claimed that the Vedic astronomy is sidereal, and since there are no Mesha etc. Rashis in the Vedas, what alternative name would you give to such a 'Mesha Samkranti'?)

2\. What do you mean by "sidereal" and how do you prove that the "Lahiri" Mesha Samkranti of April 14/15, 2021 will be sidereal?.
Pushya-Paksha Mesha Samkranti, Ramana Mesha Samkranti, Surya Siddhanta Mesha Samkranti, Vakya-Panchanga etc. Mesha Samkrantis of 2021 will not be at one and the same time as "Lahiri" Mesha Samkranti. Will all those Mesha Samkrantis also be sidereal? If so, how? If not why and how?

3. If only "Lahiri" Mesha Samkrantiis going to be sidereal according to you, what about all the other

Mesha Samkrantis?

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
