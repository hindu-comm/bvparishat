Dear Shri Kaul ji:  

  

You say:  
"***It is just not possible that it could have been written so many years back since the homo sapiens have been around for not more than 200000 years as per***

***<https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens>***

***If it is just a matter of faith, I have nothing to say and I just respect your views."***

  

and you also say:

  

"***No! Ram Navmi is to be celebrated on Shukla Paksha Navmi of Chaitra which has to be seasonal Chaitra i.e. Madhu and not "almighty" Lahiri Chaitra or "not so mighty Ramana Chaitra" and so on!***"

  

Sir this is not about you respecting my views, but about you respecting your own views.

It worries me when a person does not have consistency in their arguments and synchronisation with theircore beliefs.

  

1\. If you are very sure based on the infallible information provided in<https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens>why this agenda to fix the "right" date for Shri Rama Navami?

2\. There is a clear contradiction in your second statement that goes against your belief that Valmiki could not have recorded the heavens on Rama's date etc.

  

**  
**

**"There is an inherent contradiction in the case of Navmi tithi, Punarvasu nakshatra ......° 20' i.e. 27° 20' of Mina Rashi and not exalted therefore!**

**Shri Vinay Jha, the well known scholar of Surya Siddhanta has given a detailed analysis of the same in his "Itihas ka Upahas" available at**

**<http://vedicastrology.wdfiles.com/local--files/mockery-of-history%3Ahoroscope-of-lord-ram/Itihas%20ka%20Upahas.pdf>** "

"

With respect to your other issue regarding the problems set out by Shri Vinay Jha etc. There is an inherent assumption that Rama belonged to the Treta yuga of this yuga cycle when He was recorded as having incarnated in a previous yuga cycle.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
