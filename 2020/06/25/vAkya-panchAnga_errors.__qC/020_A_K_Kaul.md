Dear Shri Venkatesh Murthy,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your response, since unless I get some feedback, it looks like I am groping in the dark!

\<The most famous astrologer today is with no doubt Sri PVR Narasimha Rao. He has predicted correctly major events.

<https://www.vedicastrologer.org/articles/pp_ayanamsa.pdf>\>

Tough right now this topic is about festivals and their celebrations on correct days, however, since rightly or wrongly, "Vedic astrology" has become a part of "Hindu existence", I think the points raised by you must be addressed immediately!

Till a few decades back, Dr. B V Raman was known as the "Emperor among Vedic astrologers". In fact, he was the person responsible for spreading "Vedic astrology" throughout the globe through his "Astrological Magazine". Ironically, he used an Ayanamsha of his own, which was neither Lahiri nor Raivata nor even the so calledSurya Siddhanta, much less the Grahalaghava ayanamsha, leave alone Pushya-Paksha!

I may also mention here that I had met Dr. B V Raman personally after his magazine had reviewedmy "Shri Krishen Universal Ephemeris & Panchang" which advocated so called Sayana Rashichakra as it has been advocated in the Puranas, and though he had gone through the contents of my book he was very kind to say, "Tropical system is also a way of prediction and we can call it zero ayanamshaRashichakra"!  

I also met a couple of persons during my travelling life in South India, and they were all praise for Dr. Raman whom they had consulted in time of an emergency! What surprised me was their claim that Dr. Raman had made predictions without checking their horoscopes!

*Thus If making correct predictions is the only criterion for accepting an Ayanamsha as "Vedic" then it is my humble request that we must give that honour to late Dr. B V Raman and his Ayanamsha!*(Attachment BV Raman zero Ayanamsha)  

Similarly, we must not forget that there are about a dozen prominent ayanamshas in the fray these days which will be clear from

<https://www.astro.com/astrology/in_ayanamsha_e.htm>  

In any case, thus, let the "Vedic astrologers" use whatever Ayanamsha and Rashichakra they want to but then, we must separate the gamut of fasts, fairs and festivals from the same and stop calling any kind of predictive astrology as "Vedic astrology" because there is no such thing in the Vedas!

\<'However, zodiacal signs are supposed to be aligned to nakshatras, which correspond to constellations of stars in the sky. For example, the sign of Aries should contain Aswini nakshatra, Bharani nakshatra and a part of Krittika nakshatra. If we use the tropical zodiac, signs will slowly shift with time and point to different nakshatras in different eras. This is totally inconsistent with the teachings of rishis.>

Since we do not find any mention of Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, whether so called sayana or so called nirayana in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas----Rashis and even planets like, Mangal, Shani etc. are conspicuous by their absence from the "Vedanga Jyotisham" itself, or even "Atharva Jyotisham"---though the latter talks of planets---we cannot ascribe clubbing of Rashis with nakshatras to the "rishis"!

Then again, almost the entire Pauranic lore talks about so called Sayana rashis, and we find Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras being clubbed with so called Sayana Mesha etc. Rashis in the most respected Purana of the Vaishanavas and Advaitins viz. the Bhagavata Purana and Vamana Purana and so on!(Attachment Vamana-Purana-1)

Regarding predictive astrology from Sayana Rashis, kindly also go through the following article where wefind that the Saptarshi nadi
horoscopes that were discussed in this august forum a few days back also use tropical zodiac but with sidereal nakshatras!

 <https://madhivanan.in/saptarishis-used-tropical-zodiac/>  

That is really confusion worst confounded!

The following article also should be of interest!

<https://vicdicara.wordpress.com/2017/04/21/review-of-k-n-raos-article-on-the-topical-sidereal-zodiacs-and-pushya-paksha-ayanamsha/>

That there were more than 27 nakshatras in the Vedas will be clear from the attachments "AV-nakshatras".

Similarly, Nakshatra divisions in India were unequal was testifiedby a foreigner viz. Alberuni in 11th century as willbe clear from the attachment "Abhijit Division"

The following link also will give you some idea about the confusion regarding festivals!  

<http://www.pragyata.com/mag/when-should-pongalmakar-samkranti-be-celebrated-and-why-434>.  

In short, the Vedas do talk of nakshatras times without number but they never clubbed them with any Rashis, whether nirayana or sayana.
Nakshatras had an independent sphere of their own in the Vedic lore, and they were certainly "worshipped" as will be clear from Nakshatra-Sutra etc. works. However, even that Nakshatra Sukta talks of twenty-eight nakshatras (Abhijit in 21stmantra, sans any Mesha etc. Rashis!)  

So whichever way we look at it, nakshatras will have to be taken as unequal and Abhijit cannot be wished away!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
