Deat Shri Venkatesh Mutthi,

Jai Shri Ram!

Do you mean to say that Ayanamsha was negligible--virtually zero---right from the time of Maharshi Valmiki through Bhishma Nirvana and the Vedanga Jyotish and then Surya Siddhanta and then Bhaskaracharya and then Acharya Sayana and then Ranganatha and then Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi and so on!

And it has become unmanageable now, thanks to "almighty" Lahiri!

Well, I just give up and rest my discussion here!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

S K Kaul
