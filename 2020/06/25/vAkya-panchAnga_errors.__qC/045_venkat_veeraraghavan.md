Dear Sri V Murthy:

  

I am quoting you:

**Quote**

There is a big problem in Sayana method of considering only seasons. If you do that you will celebrate Rama Navami in the correct season Spring *but what happens to Nakshatra*. You may celebrate it *not in Rama's Janma Nakshatra Punarvasu* but in some other constellation like Revati. If you are celebrating Rama's birth in Revati it is totally against our tradition.

  

Same thing will happen for Krishna Janmashtami. You may correctly celebrate it in rainy season. But it *may be in Uttara Bhadra instead of Rohini or Mrugasira*. If you are celebrating Krishna Janma in such Nakshatras it is totally against our tradition.

**UNQUOTE**

Do the followingand get back if you care:

1.<https://www.drikpanchang.com/>

2\. Set the place where you stay and trawl the calendar for Janmastami and Ramanavamidates

3\. Check the nakshatra on the given dates

4\. Go through every day of the month and check the rise and fall of tithi and nakshatra

  

You will find that very rarely does tithi and relevant nakshatra combine on the same day.

This is why there is a difference in Janmashtami "celebration" dates in Tamilnadu, where the smarthas celebrate the Ashtami tithi and the Sri Vaishnavas the date of Rohini rising.

  

Plain observation will prove to you the above.

  

There is noneed for anything more complicated than that.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
