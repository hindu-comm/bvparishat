Dear Shri Kaul ji:  

  

ततो यज्ञे समाप्ते तु ऋतूनां षट् समत्ययुः \|  
ततश्च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ \|\| १-१८-८  
नक्षत्रेऽदितिदैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पंचसु \|  
ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पताविंदुना सह \|\| १-१८-९  
प्रोद्यमाने जगन्नाथं सर्वलोकनमस्कृतम् \|  
कौसल्याजनयद्रामं सर्वलक्षणसंयुतम् \|\| १-१८-१०  
विष्णोरर्धं महाभागं पुत्रमैक्ष्वाकुनंदनम् \|  
लोहिताक्षं महाबाहुं रक्तौष्ठं दुंदुभिस्वनम् \|\| १-१८-११

  

(Source-Valmiki Ramayan)

  

What Valmiki said is Satya.

And please understand Rama lived in Tretha Yuga and the Yuga calculations throw the date much much before the date you have quoted.

As for how did they calculate before computers existed.

By observation of the heavens ofcourse.

In this case Valmiki wrote through Yoga-siddhi.

There are proofs of yoga siddhi even now in this realm where Shri S.G. Karve (Of Mumbai) and his children do time rectification of horoscopesjust based on seeing the person.

  

I am surprised that you should say this of all people.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
