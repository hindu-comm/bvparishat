Dear Shri Jijith,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your mail.

As I receive every mail from the august forum bvp I have seen it already.

You might be aware that it always takes some time to collect relevant material for answering a ticklish issue without hurting anybody's feelings. Hence the delay.

Kindly bear with me till then.

In the meantime, I find that there has been an indifferent attitude towards my earlier mails in response to Shri Radhakrishna Warrier's mails. It really puts a person off!

I find it next to impossible to abide by the Law-giver Manu's admonishments:

सत्यँ ब्रूयात् प्रियँ ब्रूयात् न ब्रूयात् सत्यमप्रियँ।।

असत्यँ च प्रियँ न ब्रूयात् एष धर्मः सनातनः।।

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
