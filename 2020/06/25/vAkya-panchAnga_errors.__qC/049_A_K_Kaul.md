Shri VishvasVasukiji,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Linguistically, that's what the term chaitra means - please see pANini's sUtra with commentaries: <https://ashtadhyayi.com/sutraani/sk1223>\>

Panini is supposed to have been around in 5th century BCE. There were no Mesha, Vrisha etc. rashis, whether Sayana or nirayana, in India then!

Since 27 nakshatra divisions can be found in the Vedanga Jyotisha, without any alignment to any Rashis, starting from Krittika nakshatra division, there is every possibility that a similar Full Moon connection was found with the relevant nakshatra division vis-a-vis the lunar month!

Then again, we cannot say that Acharya Sayana as late as 14th century had not seen Panini's statements, but even then he equatedseasonal lunar Madhu with lunar Chaitra!!

This fact cannot be overlooked!

\<Generally agree with you as did the calendar committee members, but this system at least (mostly) ensures that many festivals can be celebrated with correct asterism-moon conjunction. So, it has some limited utility>  

Even if for the sake of argument, we presume that Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras were subservient to Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, we have then to correlate them with seasonal/Sayana Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis, as has been done by the most respected Purana of the Vaishnavas and Advaitins viz. the Bhagavata and Vamana and Vishnu Purna etc. as will be clear from the below quotes:             

Srimad Bhagavata 5/22/5-7 has said:

अथ स एष आत्मा लोकानां द्यावा पृथिव्योरन्तरेण नभोवलयस्य कालचक्रगतो
द्वादशमासान् भुङ्क्ते राशि संज्ञान सम्वत्सरावयवान् मासः पक्षद्वयं दिवा नक्तं चेति सपादार्क्षद्वयमुपदिशन्ति यावता शष्ठमंशं भुञ्जीत स वै ऋतुरित्युपदिश्यते संवत्सरावयवः\|5\|

> "The sun-god, who is the soul of the worlds, mounted on the wheel of > time, which is poised in the upper air, midway between earth and > heaven, passes through the twelve months that make up the year and > are known by the names of different zodiacal signs like Mesha, Vrisha > etc. The month consists of two fortnights the dark and the bright, > according to the lunar reckoning. It is one day and one night (for the > manes). *And in the course of one month the sun transits the space > occupied by two constellations (nakshatras) and a quarter. The period > he takes to traverse one sixth of the length of the zodiac is called a > season, another division of the year."* >
> अथ च यावतार्धेन नभोवीथ्यां प्रचरति तं कालमयनमाचक्षते\|6\|
> > "The time the sun takes to traverse one-half of the zodiacal belt is > called an 'ayana'."

अथ च यावन्नभोमण्डलं सह द्यावापृथिव्योर्मन्डलाभ्यां कार्त्स्न्येन् स ह् भुञ्जीत तं कालं संवत्सरं परिवत्सरमिदावत्सरम् अनुवत्सरमिति भानोर्मान्द्यशैघ्र्य सम गतिभिः समामनन्ति \|7\|

> "The period that he takes to make a circuit of the entire firmament, > between earth and heaven, is called by different names, 'samvatsara', > 'parivatsara', 'ida-vatsara', 'anuvatsara', and 'vatsara', to denote > the reckoning of the period in different ways according as it takes > into account the acceleration, retardation and even movement of the > sun's transit."(Translation by K Ragunathan, Vigneshwar Publishing > House, Madras/Bangalore) >
>   
> > Here it has been made clear that a solar month comprises two and a > quarter nakshatras, two such months make a season and such six seasons > make a year named Samvatsara etc. which are the same names of solar > years as in the Vedanga Jyotisham and the Mahabharata etc. >
> Here the lunar as well as the solar months are seasonal, i.e. tropical > and it is those very solar months that have been said to contain two > and a quarter nakshatra each.

The same thing has been explained in detail in the Vamana Purana 5/34 (Gita Press edition):

आदित्यंशश्च पुष्यं च आश्लेषा शशिनो गृहं\| राशिः कर्कटको नाम पार्श्वे मख विनाशिनः \|\|

> "The last quarter of Punarvasu, entire Pushya and Ashlesha nakshatra > are part of Karkata Rashi".
> > The same Vamana Purana has said in 16/12

ततो दिवाकरो राशिं संप्रयाति च कर्कटम्\| ततो अमराणां रजनी भवति दक्षिनायणं\|\|

"After that the sun enters Karkata Rashi. That is the start of Dakshinayana (Summer Solstice) known as the night of gods".

So here also the nakshatras have been clubbed with tropical months and rashis!

Even in this twenty first century, the Karkata Rashi is said to be formed by the same nakshatras viz. a quarter of Punarvasu, whole Pushya and Ashlesha nakshatra, but then unfortunately, without any rhyme or reason, it is de-linked from Dakshinayana, against the injunctions of all the Puranas and shastras!

Thus when the same Vamana Purana says in 5/40:

उत्तरांशास्त्रयो ऋक्षं श्रवणं मकरो मुनेधनिष्ठार्धं शनिक्षेत्रं ...i.e.  
"O Seer, three quarters of Uttarashadha, complete Shravana nakshatra and two quarters of Dhanishtha comprise Makara Rashi", it means naturally that the Makara Rashi of Vamana Purana is also nothing but the start of the six months of Uttarayana, i.e. Makar Samkranti has to be the shortest day of the year!"

It is not only the Vamana Purana or Bhagavata Purana etc. but almost all the other Puranas like Shiva Maha Purana, Narada Purana, Vishnudharmottara Purana etc. also declare unequivocally that irrespective of the Rashi that a particular nakshatra may be in, it has to be in alignment with the seasons! In other words, the Mesha, Vrisha etc. signs as well as the nakshatras that are subsumed in them have to be so called Sayana (tropical)!

Since Dr. Raman is supposed to have collected the birth details of Bhagwan Krishna from Srimad Bhagavata etc., evidently, he has overlooked the glaring fact that Shrimad Bhagavata is talking of nothing but a seasonal Rashichakra! How could Bhagwan Krishna have Incarnated in a niraadhaar nirayana that too in Ramana Ayanamsharasichakra!

Such points need to be pondered over and that too very very carefully!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
