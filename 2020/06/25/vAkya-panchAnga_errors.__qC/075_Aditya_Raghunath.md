Dear Scholars,

Apologies for wading into the debate, however I've some basic question here. There are many arguments about celebrating Ram Navami, Krishna Janmashtami based on tithis/nakshatras. However, was there any precedence of celebrating these festivals in ancient times. Does Mahabharata or Vishnu puraana talks about celebrating these festivals. Are these festivals not of recent origin and have come out more because of faith/devotion/tradition rather than defined by shastras.

  

I'm not a subject matter expert here, so please treat this comment accordingly.
