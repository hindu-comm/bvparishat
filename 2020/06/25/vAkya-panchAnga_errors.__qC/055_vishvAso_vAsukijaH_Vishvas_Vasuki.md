Certainly yes. Even now, they're mostly off by tens of minutes.  

As the committee wrote: "In India, astronomical observations stopped from about 1200 A.D. after the advent of the Turkish invaders, when Indian observatories were either destroyed or abandoned by the astronomers and calendar making fell into the hands of astrologers, who had to depend on ancient treatises. "

Yet to check thoroughly, but from Rgvedic times (following Tilak's interpretation):  

``` " स्व॑र्भानो॒रध॒ यदि॑न्द्र मा॒या अ॒वो दि॒वो वर्त॑माना अ॒वाह॑न् ।  गू॒ऴं सूर्यं॒ तम॒साप॑व्रतेन तु॒रीये॑ण॒ ब्रह्म॑णा (=device or axial division) ऽविन्द॒दत्रिः॑ ।।" ```

  

Here is a recent record:

"during the solar eclipse of August 18, 1868 raghunAthAchAri was able to demonstrate his predictions: He got the eclipse time correct with an error of 12 seconds using calculations done by his hand while the traditional astronomers performed dismally with a whopping 24 minute error. This had a strong effect and many traditional Hindus now switched over to his side. He then demolished the most recalcitrant traditional astronomers in a sadas of brāhmaṇa-s of the Dramiḍa country. Seeing this the Śaṃkara maṭha sent out a circular stating that the Vedic ritualists Venkateshvara Dikshita and Sundaresha Shrautin were correct in adopting modern theory and techniques for their rituals. His efforts were paralleled by those of Ketkar in Maharashtra and Venkatakrishna Raya in Andhra to get the Hindus to use modern astronomical calculations."
