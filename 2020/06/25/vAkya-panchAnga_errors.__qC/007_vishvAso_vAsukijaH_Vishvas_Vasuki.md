Could you please elaborate on this (preferably with references or quotations)? What are the "vAkyapanchanga"-s commonly used in south India?

This is an admirable attempt. I'd use it if it had a few improvements (adhikamAsa computation as per kauNDinyAyana system, location specificity - noon times at Chennai and bengaLUru are different, muhUrta listing ...) Is there a website for this calendar? How is sAyanification/ tropicalization done (ie which naxatra is the sun taken to be during spring equinox)?

Wow! Is this hearsay, or is there a textual record that I can note down?

I find this statement perplexing. For example, Could you demonstrate how rAShTriya panchAnga (whose naxatra positions are defined based on stellar offsets in 1950-s) is not sidereal - or atleast not approximately so?

I find this sentence very hard to parse. Could you rewrite it as a more comprehensible paragraph?
