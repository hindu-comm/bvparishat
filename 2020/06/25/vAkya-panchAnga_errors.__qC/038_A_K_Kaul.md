Dear Shri Venkatesh Murthy,

Jia Shri Ram!

\< You can worship Rama and Krishna and other gods in the right season but the blessings of Nakshatras will not be on you. \>

The Valmiki Ramayana 1/15/29 and 7/99/9 (Gita Press edition) tell us
that Bhagwan Ram Ruled for 11000 years!

And quitea few scholars claim that the Mahabharata war took place in 3101/3102 BCE.

That means Bhagwan Ram was around in at least 14000 BCE.

I do not know as to how anybody could have calculated the planetary position together with the tithi nakshatra etc. of Bhagwan Ram and Bharata etc., as given in the Valmiki Ramayana 2/18 in that distantpast!  

Similarly, though Dr. B V Raman calculated a horoscope of Bhagwan Krishna for July 19, 3228 BCE since there were no computers around in1950s, Dr. Raman had to get it prepared by Cyril Fagan.

There are absolutely no references to any planetary positions of any of the Pandavas or Kauravas, least of all Bhagwan Krishna, in any of the Puranas or the Mahabharata, or Harivamsha. I do not know how anybody could have calculated a horoscope---that too nirayana--- then, especially since we do not find Mesha, Vrisha etc. Rashis whether Sayana or Nirayana in the Mahabharata at all and the Rashis that we find in the Puranas including the Srimad Bhagavata or Vishnu or Vamana or Shiva or Vishnu-dharmottara etc.etc. are all so called Sayana!

The seasonal months like Shravana/Bhadra Krishna Ashtami and (nirayana) Rohini nakshatra could not have coincided even then in 3228 BCE and that is why Dr. Raman had to resort to a nirayana Rashichakra that too with his own Ayanamsha!

Similarly, when the planets like Mangal, Shani etc. were not around in India in 1500 BCE at the time of the Vedanga Jyotisha, it is virtually impossible that a horoscope of Bhagwan Ram could really have been prepared in at least 14000 BCE!

Thus IMHO seasonal Chaitra Shukla Navmi should be taken asShri Rama Navmi without hankering for any particular nakshatra!

Similarly, seasonal Shravana (mukhya-mana) Krishna Ashtami whether or not coupled with Rohini should be taken as Shri Krishna Janmashthami!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
