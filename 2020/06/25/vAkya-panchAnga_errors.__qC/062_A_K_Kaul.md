Shri Vishvas Vasuki,

Jai Shri Ram!

All the Vedas claim मधुश्च माधवश्च वासन्तिकावृतू and so on.

The Vedanga Jyotish has clubbed Madhu and Madhava with Vasant Ritu and so on.

All the Purana have clubbed Madhu and Madhava with Vasant Ritu and so on.

The well known Vedic commentator viz. Acharya Sayana also has equated Madhu with Chaitra, Madhava with Vaishakha and so on and clubbed them with respective seasons.

There are absolutely no exceptions in the same.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
