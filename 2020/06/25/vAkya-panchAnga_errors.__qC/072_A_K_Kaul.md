Dear Shri Venkatesh Murthy,

Jai Shri Ram!

\< I mean when the Surya Siddhanta was being used in ancient times the Ayanamsha was small. Now the difference between Sayana and Nirayana is 22 days but in those days it was a few days only. Therefore there was no problem if the festivals were late by a few days and on or close to the correct Nakshatras.>

We are again back to square one!

As per Triprashnadhikara, shlokas 9-11 of the SS, the SS (oscillating!) Ayanamsha was zero in 498 CE. Lahiri Ayanamsha zero year was 285 CE.
Munjal advised to add one arc minute to mean longitudes from Shaka 444 to make the "nirayana" longitudes Sayana---actually to make the incorrect longitudes of the SS and Aryabhatiya etc. correct!

Here the crux of the argument is as to what type of Rashichakra, if any at all, was being used at the time of the Incarnation of Bhagwan Krishna or Bhagwan Ram!

1\. In the first case, Dr. B V Raman has on pages 17 to 19 of his "Notable Horoscopes" claimed that all the information about the birth nakshatra and timing etc. of Bhgwan Krishna he had obtained from Srimad Bhagavata, Shri Vishnu Purana and Harivamsha!

Now the million dollar question is that all these scriptures, without exception, talk in one voice that a tropical Rashichakra is to be used for all purposes!

Attachments "VP Rashis-1"," Bhagavata-1", "Mahabharata-Vishuva".

2, The following excerpts from Srimad Bhagavata and Vamana Purana etc. also prove that Ashvini, Bharni etc. nakshatras, of equal divisions also were clubbed with so called sayana Rashis

Srimad Bhagavata 5/22/5-7 has said:

अथ स एष आत्मा लोकानां द्यावा पृथिव्योरन्तरेण नभोवलयस्य कालचक्रगतो
द्वादशमासान् भुङ्क्ते राशि संज्ञान सम्वत्सरावयवान् मासः पक्षद्वयं दिवा नक्तं चेति सपादार्क्षद्वयमुपदिशन्ति यावता शष्ठमंशं भुञ्जीत स वै ऋतुरित्युपदिश्यते संवत्सरावयवः\|5\|
