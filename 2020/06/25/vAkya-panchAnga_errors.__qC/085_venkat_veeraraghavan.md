Dear Shri Kaul ji,  

  

I have NOT court marshalled you here.

This episode would have had a one post quick death if you had just acknowledged the discrepancy and moved on.

Instead someone else stepped in and made it a spectacle.

  

I actually have sympathy for your agenda and think that you deserve a debate with knowledgeable people in this forum (this does not include me.) since this is an important issue that needs to be fixed (if at all).  

The only worry is something I have elaborated on. Kindly give it due thought since I believe yourassumptions detract from and hurt your agenda.

I hope you can get traction with the people that matter.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
