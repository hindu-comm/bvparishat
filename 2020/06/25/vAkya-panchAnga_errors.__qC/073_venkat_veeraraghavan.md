Dear Shri Vishvas ji,

  

My contention is pretty simple:

  

If a person is pretty certain based on the gospel of britannica that Valmiki Bhagavan fudged the date of Rama or winged it as put in urban lingo, what is the point of running a campaign for the "correct" celebration of festivals etc?

  

Sentiment? No one runs campaigns based on sentiment.

  

There are many people on this list who wish to model the intangibles mentioned in shastra. While I may not agree with them, I understand their motivations and where they are coming from.

  

Now let me address the other points you raise:

  

" I believe that the scientific theories about the origin of our species is pretty accurate (far more so than other alternatives). I take it that you are averse to such theories? "

  

\>\> Again this is a belief system.

   A deluge of data points does not indicate accuracy or 20-20 vision.

   Data is only as good as the people who collect it and are you really sure the people who collect data and     those who fund such efforts are not inherently prejudiced and investing in a certain narrative?

   A scientific theory is just that a speculative schema based on selected data points of what *might* have       been. How do you know all data points observed have been considered without a selective purge?

   

One of the attention span poor, data/sensory overloaded lives we lead is that there are limits on the amount of time we can spend in doing due diligence.

  

What alternatives did you have in mind?

  

" I take it that you are averse to such theories? "

  

\>\> Oh no. I am not averse. Merely amused.

  

" rAma may be part historical, part myth - but whatever the proportion,
the rAmAyaNa is a divine work, rAma is an avatAra, "

  

\>\> Within one sentence you move from "may be part....part myth" to "is an avatara". I understand a certain amount of agnostisicm is natural without personal experience, so there is very little value in discussing this in such a forum.

The reasonable course for me is to say that one has shraddha and trusts in Valmiki as one trusts in one's mother.

After all DNA tests have been available since the last 30 years.

Why not also make our mothers take a DNA test to check if they were telling us the truth about our parentage?

  

Science also believes that a human cannot survive without food for more than 3 days and the current official record is 40 days or so. Prahlad Jani or Ram Bahadur Bomjan or Giri Bala are unexplainable in the light of what science considers AXIOM. You know axioms are fundamental immutable laws of a system and if changed all the speculation downstream gets flushed down the rabbit hole.

Science tells you an organic body cannot survive in fire.

I have seen with my eyes within a distance of 1 feet an 80 year old man rolling on the blazing flames of a 5x5 sqft homa kunda, with no ill effect whatsoever.

I was getting dehydrated very fast despite being in better physical shape and less than half his age.



I have not seen any of the keyboard warriors replicate such a proof of agni stambhana.

  

I can go on, but I guess you get my point.

  

And yes.

If the choice is Valmiki or some snob of a "scientist"

I will choose Valmiki everytime!

  

Not because I am sentimental, but because that is what my life experiences in the groves of academia and on the road have taught me.

  

" hence we want to celebrate his festival at the most aesthetically appropriate time; we want his mandir in the place of the demolished rAxasAlaya etc.. It is a more matter of sentiment than fact. "

  

\>\>Agree with the right time for Ram Navami and the temple, but disagree that this should be on the basis of sentiment alone.

Fact changes based on the individuals adhikara and state of evolution.

What may be fact for Prahlad Jani might be mythical for the two of us.

But where we differ is in the way we choose to deal with what is not within the ambit of our personal experience.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
