Namaste Sri Venkat Veeraraghavan

  

I already know what you have written. I am not saying exact Nakshatra and Tithi has to match in festivals. But the difference between the Nakshatra and Tithi days will be one day mostly. We Smartas will have the Janmashtami on Ashtami and Sri Vaishnavas may have the same on next day with Rohini Nakshatra.

But the difference will not be like 3 or 4 or 5 days or more.

  

If you follow Sri Kaul's Panchanga you will get a bigger difference between Tithi and Nakshatra. That is not the only problem. The difference will become bigger and bigger with passing years and decades. To this Sri Kaul is arguing Nakshatra is not at all important for festivals. Why? Because he wants to ignore this problem. This is not correct.
