Dear Shri Kaul ji,  

  

I am frankly not interested in Shri Nilesh Oak's position since I think Dr. Manish Pandit has effectively disproved his MB war dates with quotes from the text.

I have explained my position in a different post and don'tsee any point repeating myself.

  

There has to be alignment between sankalpa and agenda.

This was clearly brought out by the case of Shri Madhusudhan Sarasvati writing Advaita Siddhi while desiring the darshan of Lord Krishna.

The great man had significant issues with mantra siddhi even after even 17 purascharanas.

  

I think there is a lesson in there for all of us.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
