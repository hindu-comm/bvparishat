Of course, I read your quote (as should have been clear from my response). Where does it say or even suggest that a person following nirayana calendar for his daily life will not get moxa? It does not. Whatever his calendrical belief, the brahmavettA gets this gati.

Siderial means a star-based division of the ecliptic circle. (In contrast, tropical means division with reference to the equinoctial colure.) Whatever the ayanAMsha offset, they're all siderial. What was your definition when you claimed that rAShTriya panchanga was not siderial??

  

  

"1. Would you be kind enoughto quote even as single mantra from the Vedic lore, a single shloka from any of the Puranas or a single shloka from any siddhanta which has advised us to celebrate a "Mesha Samkranti" when the days and nights or not equal." - This is not relevant to my question at all; but ALL 12 sankrAnti-s are to be celebrated according to shAstra-s (you should dig up references from a work such as nirNaya sindhu yourself.) It's just that this sankrAnti is not same as ayanArambha.
