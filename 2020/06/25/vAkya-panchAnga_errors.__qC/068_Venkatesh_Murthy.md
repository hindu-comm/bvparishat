Namaste Sri Murthy Mahodaya

  

The matter is not so simple. If we make the Sankrantis and Solstices same now we will not have Nakshatra accuracy. Or if we chase Nakshatra accuracy we will not have Tithi accuracy. Take for example, Ramanuja Jayanti given in the Reformed Hindu Calendar sent by Sri Kaul. In that calendar they have given Ramanuja Jayanti as April 2. But it is Navami Tithi. No where I have heard Sri Vaishnavas celebrating it on Navami. It is on Panchami or at most Sashti always. In the Drik Panchangam it is given correctly as April 28 with Panchami.
