I am not confused but you are. I can prove it below.

  

I hope you know the following details.

  

Full moon day of Chaitra month will be at or close to Chitta Nakshatra

Full moon day of Vaishakha month will be at or close to Visakha Nakshatra

and so on.... full moon day of Magha month will be at or close to Magha Nakshatra

Full moon day of Phalguna will be at or close to Phalguni Nakshatras.

  

You can now open the Panchanga sent by Sri Kaul attached claiming to be the correct Tropical Panchanga correct in seasons.

What do you see there?

Magha Purnima on 2020 January 10 with Ardra Nakshatra. This is not close to Magha Nakshatra.

Holika Dahan Phalguna Purnima on 2020 February 8 with Punarvasu Nakshatra. This is not close to Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra.

Chaitra Purnima on 2020 March 9 with Magha Nakshatra. This is not close to Chitta Nakshatra. Big gap.

Should I go on or you see the problem? One more example.

Vaishakha Purnima on 2020 April 7 with Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra. This is not close to Vishakha Nakshatra.

This gap in Nakshatras will not be just for Purnima but for all festivals.

Not only this but the gap will become bigger and bigger with time. This is the big problem.

  

That is why I said if you go for correct seasons you will give up Nakshatras and if you go for correct Nakshatras you will give up seasons.

  

I say give up seasons. Why? Because Nakshatras are more important and powerful in our tradition of ancient Rishis.

  

Therefore Nirayana is victorious over Sayana calendar.
