Dear Shri Venkatesh Murthy,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks again for your response!

In fact, what problems/difficulties you are expressing are the same/similar that I faced myself while analyzing the gamut of our fasts, fairs and muhurtas!

\< Almost all important festivals have a nakshatra we have to celebrate them when the nakshatra is close to celebration day.>

This is exactly putting the cart before the horse!  

No! Ram Navmi is to be celebrated on Shukla Paksha Navmi of Chaitra which has to be seasonal Chaitra i.e. Madhu and not "almighty" Lahiri Chaitra or "not so mighty Ramana Chaitra" and so on!

It may be coupled with Punarvasu nakshatra on that very day or not --- that does not matter much!

Here are the proofs:Valmiki Ramayana 2/18/7 has said

ततश्च द्वादशे मासे चैत्रे नावमिके तिथौ \| नक्षत्रे अदिति दैवत्ये स्वोच्चसंस्थेषु पञ्चसु \|

ग्रहेषु कर्कटे लग्ने वाक्पातविन्दुना सह \|प्रोद्यमाने जगन्नाथं सर्वलोक नमस्कृतं\|\|

कौसल्या जनयद्रामं दिव्यलक्षण संयुतम् \|\|

''After six seasons had elapsedsince the yajnyawas performed, in the twelfth month of Chaitra on Navmi Tithi, Punarvasu nakshatra, with five planets exalted, the Ascendant being Karkata with the moon and Jupiter posited in it, Sri Rama was born"

The confusion here is about Chaitra, since all along it has been dinned into our ears by our Panchanga-makers that lunar months are either Lahiri or Ramana or some other nirayana!

But did the Valmiki Ramayana really mean a nirayana Chaitra? No!
Nirayana was unheard of then, as is evident from the avalanche of proofsI have provided from all the Vedas, the Puranas and even the siddhantas!

The Surya Siddhanta, the Siddhanta Shekhara and even Bhaskaracharya have in one voice said that a lunar new year for calculating the Panchanga has to start from the month Madhu, which has been translated as lunar Chaitra by all the commentators! Obviously, it is seasonal Chaitra!

Acharya Sayana has in one voice clubbed the months of lunar Chaitra and Vaishakha with Vasanta Ritu and so on 7whether in Taittiriya Samhita or Samaveda or Shatapatha Brahmana and so on!

That the Valmiki Ramayana also was talking of a Chaitra of Vasanta Ritu will be clear from 2/3/4 which states

चैत्रः श्रीमानयं मासः पुण्यः पुष्पित काननः \| यौवराज्याय रामस्य सर्वमेवोपकल्प्यताम् \|\|

"It is the month of resplendent Chaitra and the flowers are in full blossom in the forests. You may therefore make preparations for anointing Rama as the heir regent"

That leaves no doubt in anybody's mind that Maharshi Valmiki was talking about the seasonal Cahitra-cum-Madhu.

If you go through the VR with a tooth comb you will literally find that all the lunar months that it has talked about are nothing but seasonal and not Lahiri months!

Other "Ramayanas" have reiterated/clarified the same point in a very unambiguous manner!

Goswami Tulsidas has said in his immortal Rama Charitamanasa--Balakanda  

नवमी तिथि मधुमास पुनीता सुकल पच्छ अभिजित हरि प्रीता।

मध्य दिवस अति सीत न गामा। पावन काल लोक विश्रामा।

"It was Shukla Paksha Navmi of the month of holy Madhu, it being Abhijit which is dear to Bhagwan Vishnu, the time was midday when it was neither very hot nor very cold..."

Goswami Tulsidas is silent about the Punarvasu nakshatra of Bhagwan Ram! Why? We shall see it shortly!

 *The Gita Press has translated "Madhu" of Goswamiji as Chaitra!* (Attachment Tulsidasji-Madhu=Chaitra)  

Similarly, Adhyatma Ramayana, which is a part of Brahmanda Purana, has said in 1/3/13

मधुमासे सिते पक्षेनवम्यां कर्कटे शुभे \| पुनर्वस्वृक्ष सहिते उच्चस्थे ग्रह पञ्चके \|\|

मेषं पूषणि संप्राप्ते पुष्पवृष्टि समाकुले ....

''On shukla Paksha Navmi of the month of Madhu, in Punarvasu nakshatra, with five planets exalted with the sun was in Mesha"

The attachment ''Adyatma Ramayana-Madhu=Chaitra" shows as to how the month of Madhu has been translated as Chaitra by the Gita Press tanslators, exactly as it was translated by Ranganatha or Pandit Sudhakar Dwivedi and so on while commenting on the "Madhu-mas" of the Surya Siddhanta etc.!

And as you must be aware, Gita Press is a name to reckon with!

So whether the "niraayana-walas" like it or not, the month of Chaitra in our Vedas, Puranas, itihasas and siddhantas is nothing but the month of Madhu and the month of Madhu is nothing but Chaitra!!  
\< Ramanavami is with Punarvasu but actually it maybe with Ardrata nakshatra or neighbouring nakshatra"!>

I am attaching "Shri Mohan Krity Arsha Patrakam" in Hindi, compiled by Shri Darshaney Lokesh. As per page 45 of this work, Shri Ramanavmi was on March 4, 2020, when Mrigashira nakshatra had ended and Ardra nakshatra started at 8-09 hrs. IST. Ardra nakshatra ended at 3-29 of March 6, when Punarvasu started.

Thus it was exactly within two days from Shri Ramanavmi, as desired by you!

As such by following the "Reformed Hndu Calendar" not only are you celebrating Shri Ramanavmi in the month of Madhu, as advised by our scriptures actually, but within Punarvasu nakshatra plus or minus a couple of days, exactly what is happening in the case of ''almighty" Lahiri Ramanavmi, with the only difference that you are celebrating it in a wrong month in the nirayana confusion!

Thus here you really have the cake and you can eat it as well! 

It will continue to be like that in future also since adhika-masa in the case of seasonal solar months vis-a-vis seasonal lunar months is more scientific and that will make the nakshatras pegged to the festivals within a couple of days plus or minus!

\< You have tried to argue against this saying there is no Rama Janma details available in our texts. But Sri Vishwas has given you references. \>

There is an inherent contradiction in the case of Navmi tithi, Punarvasu nakshatra equal divisionand the sun in Mesha in the Valmiki and other Ramayanas!!

Punarvasu nakshatra ranges from 20 degrees of Mithuna to 3° 20' of Karkata in equal division. And for Navmi tithi, the Moon has to be ahead of the sun between 96° and 108°. As the moon cannot be more than 93° 20' if it has to be in Punarvasu, the sun has to be anywhere at the most 93° 20' minus (360°+ 93° 20'-96°)=357° 20' i.e. 27° 20' of Mina Rashi and not exalted therefore!

Shri Vinay Jha, the well known scholar of Surya Siddhanta has given a detailed analysis of the same in his "Itihas ka Upahas" available at

<http://vedicastrology.wdfiles.com/local--files/mockery-of-history%3Ahoroscope-of-lord-ram/Itihas%20ka%20Upahas.pdf>  

He is also of the opinion that Bhagwan Ram had Incarnted in the fag end of Treta Yuga which was around about 870000 years back as per the Surya Siddhanta!  

I will take up the case of Shri Krishna Janmashtami, as to how we are being compelled by "Vedic Panchanga-makers" to celebrate it on wrong days, like all the other festivals!

*The parting short is that those claiming that they are celebrating festivals as per "aarsha Siddhanta" viz. the Surya Siddhanta are celebrating all the festivals on wrong days---even the reverred Jagadgurus being no exception!--- since the SS has started the new lunar year from Madhu i.e. seasonal Chaitra and not Lahiri Chaitra!*

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

PS

I had to truncate the "Shri Mohan Krity Arsha Patrakam" of some pages because the Google groups do not accept attachments of moe than 8 mb.
If any one wants the complete version, he may write to me at jyotirved-at-gmail-dot-com or to Shri Darshaney Lokesh, to whom a copy is being endorsed.
