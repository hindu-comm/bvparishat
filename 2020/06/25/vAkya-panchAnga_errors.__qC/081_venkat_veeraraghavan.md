Dear Shri Vishvas Ji-->  

  

I would have let this slide if you had said this privately, but you chose otherwise, so here goes:

  

You have gone on a parallel journey diverting well away from the prime issue I raised about Shri Kaul's divergence between core belief and agenda.

I merely answered many of the tropes you raised about sentimentalism vs 'fact'.

  

Nowhere have I dissed science, but I have merely questioned the motivations of 'scientists' and thepeople who fund them. When I used the word science believesetc I obviously meant its practitioners believe etc.....As a vidvan of Sanskrit I expected you to make the connection.... My mistake.

" Yes, there are people (religious and otherwise) who do extraordinary things"  

  

Michael Phelps and Usain Bolt are extraordinary. Grisha Perelman and Terence Tao are extraordinary. They all have done extraordinary things.

The man who enters fire in his physical body without protection is beyond a scientific explanation as is the man/woman who can survive without food/water.

You are of course welcome to put your own spin on it. Whatever helps you sleep at night.

Since you are so high on myth as you call it you may also know that such narrative building is essential for mediocrity to thrive and survive.



I trained as an engineer and I realise thepractical value of science enough to not be the fool youso conveniently assume me to be. I understand Science and myth creation wellenough tonot be condescended to.

It must be comforting to be the chosen one. I congratulate you on that. Manasataramgini would be proud.

And do yourself a favour. Ask yourself whether you really know someone well enough to implythey are an idiot for not sharing your world view.  

  

I will just address the one relevant point to this thread and leave it at that.

  

Equating Galwan killing of 20 soldiers on a REAL LAC and a campaign for Rama Navami when the campaigner does not believe in the sacredness of Valmiki's words regarding shukla Chaitra Navami is a comparison only a person who lacks clarity or perspective can make.

  

Since you are clueless or atleast portray yourself that way, let me educate you:-->

  

There is mutual agreement between 2 nations on what an LAC is and they agree to respect the border. That is the fundamental basis of trust thatgoverns that part of the relationship.

When this is violated it destroys trust which is the basis of any relationship.

This is NOT sentiment. It is realpolitik. You are conflating 7 PM TV and 24x7 TRPs (which do run on sentiment) with politics and asset management on the ground.

The 500 rupee note and the stock price again is NOT sentiment.

It is a shared TRUST between demand and supply 'actors' governed by athirdparty (Government or Math/Software in the case of Crypto ).

Sentiment can make stock prices fluctuate but without sound fundamentals and TRUST no company can survive in the stock market.

You really should pay attention to first principles.

It makes sure you don'tsay something vacuously inane downstream...and that too publicly.

  

Let us assume Valmiki did fudge facts or was as clueless as you assume Him to be. So predicated on that assumption ***why drive a campaign for the "right" Ramanavami?***

  

Since you are so high on SHARED sentiment,

Did the people ask for it?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
