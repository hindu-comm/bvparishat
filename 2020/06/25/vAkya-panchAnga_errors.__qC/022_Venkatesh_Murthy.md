If you follow seasons only you will give up Nakshatras. If you follow Nakshatras only you will give up seasons. Which is more important?

  

If you think seasons are important do according to your faith in seasons. You will always find some or other text to justify it. I think Nakshatras are important and I will follow them. And crores of Nirayana followers also do the same.
