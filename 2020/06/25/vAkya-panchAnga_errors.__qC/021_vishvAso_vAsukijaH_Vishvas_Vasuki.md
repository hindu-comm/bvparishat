You sadly have it backwards there. Let me try to explain with a pair of concrete examples.  

  
Take upAkarma. Apastamba says: "(आर्तव)श्रवणा(पूर्व)पक्ष ओषधीषु जातासु हस्तेन पौर्णमास्यां वा ऽध्यायोपाकर्म २". So, when do saplings sprout? At the beginning of the (khArif) rainy season, around the summer solstice time in north India. This happened to be shrAvaNa around 1000BCE. The crops don't srout when xyz-ayanAMsha based month happens to be "shrAvaNa". That's when adhyAya-upAkarma should be celebrated. Effectively, the naxatra-chakra should be "tropicalized" so that shrAvaNa pUrNimA falls around the time of solstice. People who claim to follow Apastamba by celebrating sometime in August are the same sort of comedians (unwitting or otherwise) who would "show" arundhati at noon during faux-vivAha rituals.  

  

Then take sarpabali. Apastamba says: "श्रावण्यां पौर्णमास्यामस्तमिते स्थालीपाकः ५ ... मार्गशीर्ष्यां पौर्णमास्यामस्तमिते स्थालीपाकः ३", and recommends giving bali to sarpa-s between shrAvaNa pUrNimA and mArgashIrSha pUrNimA. The timing is again tuned to nature - rainy season is when snakes come out of their flooded homes, and incidence of snake bites increase. So, again, anyone more interested in the spirit as well as letter of the AchArya will offset the naxatra-chakra so that shrAvaNa falls around solstice time - yes, tropicalization again. It is again comical if people keep giving bali-s in December. (Of course, people can start saying that "sarpa-s" are not snakes and that it is some "yoga" to be out of sync with nature - but they're welcome to their private universe. I will stick to the AchArya Apastamba.)

  

Who celebrates events using suitably tropicalized naxatra-s? FYI, I do - been offering the daily bali-s for about a month now.
