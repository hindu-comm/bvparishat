Dear Shri Venkat Veeraraghavan,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Sir this is not about you respecting my views, but about you respecting your own views.

It worries me when a person does not have consistency in their arguments and synchronisation with theircore beliefs.\>

I am quoting below my original mail to which you have responded with the above comments:

Quote

\< And please understand Rama lived in Tretha Yuga and the Yuga calculations throw the date much much before the date you have quoted.>

As per Aryabhata, Tretayuga ended 2020+3101 (years of Kaliyuga)+ 1080000 years of Dwapara Yuga i.e. 1085121 years back.

According to the Surya Siddhanta, Tretayuga ended 2020+3101 (years of Kaliyuga)+ 864000 years of Dwaparayuga i.e. 869121 years back.

But the earliest date of "Rama Ravana Yuddha" claimed by present scholars is 12209 BCE as per Nilesh Oak, 7323 BCE as year of Incarnation as per late Dr. P V Vartak and January 14, 5114 BCE as per late Pushkar Bhatnagar!

In any case, your view that Bhagwan Ram had incarnated either about 1085000 or about 869000 years back is in agreement with the Pauranic lore that the yugas have very long duration. My grandfather, my father and even I myself had a similar view till a few decades back .

The Valmiki Ramayana that we have around these days is supposed to have been "compiled" by the same Maharshi Valmiki who was a contemporary of Bhagwan Ram!

Unquote

1\. Now that we have two systems of yugas, one as per Aryabhata and the other as per the Surya Siddhanta, with different durations of yugas, which means Bhagwan Ram could have Incarnated about 869000 years back as per the Surya Siddhanta but about 1085000 years as per Aryabhata!

Which yuga system do you believe and why?

2. As per Aryabhata, to start with Kaliyuga started at the midnight of February17/18, 3102 BCE, but then he "recreated" it just within six hours at 6-00 am (Mean Ujjain Time) of February 18, 3102 BCE.

When did the Kaliyuga start actually according to you and why?

3\. Before taking up this issue of the year of Incarnation of Bhagwan Ram with me, you should take it up with Shri Nilesh Oak, who claims to have proved that there was Rama Ravana Yuddha in 12209 BCE, whereas I have never said anything regarding the actual year of Incarnation of BhagwanRam!

Similarly, there are innumerable scholars of Bharatvarsha who have "proved" it that the Mahabharata war took place much after 3102 BCE, i.e. after Kaliyuga had started!

That just is not possible as per our siddhantas and scriptures.

I think you should take up cudgels with one and all of them since they are trashing your yuga duration theory,though ou are not yourself sure as to whether to go by Aryabhata yugas or the SS yugas!!

Needless to mention here that all the scholars, including Shri Nilesh Oak, have impeccable credentials and none can be said to be pandering to the whims of some overseas scholar!

After you have taken up this issue with the respective scholars and convinced them of your yuga duration of hundreds of thousands of years, kindly let me know the outcome.

\<1. If you are very sure based on the infallible information provided in<https://www.britannica.com/topic/Homo-sapiens-sapiens>why this agenda to fix the "right" date for Shri Rama Navami?

2\. There is a clear contradiction in your second statement that goes against your belief that Valmiki could not have recorded the heavens on Rama's date etc.\>

We can decide about this information being infallible or not only after you have convinced every scholar that Ramaa Ravana Yuddha had really taken place either 1085000 years back or 870000 years back, depending upon which yuga duration you believe!

Please also see to it that the Mahabharata war is supposed to have taken place in 5116 BCE as per Shri Nilesh Oak. That means about 2000 years before Kaliyuga had started! How could that be so?

Till then, with regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
