Pranam sir,

  

This lecture by Prof. PP Divakaran at 30 mins -<https://youtu.be/yWZ15EKElH0?t=1766> - contains a brief discussion of Kim Plofker's work, although not specfically a review of the book you have asked.

  

The speaker is a theoretical physicist, and the talk is given at International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS Bangalore).

  

Of course, since Prof. Divakaran is only based in Chennai Mathematical Institute, maybe his work is not valued that much.

  

Namaskar,

Bandhavi
