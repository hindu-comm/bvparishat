Dear Dr. Ramakrishnan,

  

In response to your query, I am enclosing two reviews of Prof.Plofker's book.

  

The first review is by the distinguished mathematician (Field's Medallist), David Mumford, who uses this occasion to highlight some of the seminal contributions of Indian mathematicians; and to emphasise that, even in mathematics, there can be different approaches to arrive at significant results.  

  

The other review is by Prof. Satyanand Kichenassamy, a Prof. of Mathematics in France,who has also done pioneering work in the history of mathematics. He has done a scholarly critical review of the book.  

  

Since the publication of Prof. Plofker's book in 2010, there have been some landmark publications on Indian Mathematics, which discuss the technical content, and methodology of Indian Mathematics, in much greater detail. In particular, I would refer you to the following:  

  

1.George G Joseph, Indian Mathematics Engaging with the World from Ancient to Modern Time,World Scientific, 2016.

2.P.P.Divakaran,The Mathematics of India Concepts, Methods, Connections,Hindustan Book Agency and Springer, 2018.
