Dear sir,

  

There was not even a slightest indication of doubting your credentials in my post.

  

My post was only about the credentials of the scholars suggested by Sri Padmashree Anand with regard to they being eligible to give their opinion.

  

Your opinion about the book under question will certainly help Dr Balasubramanian Ramakrishnan. You might want to give a more detailed opinion too helping him.

  

Similarly the suggested scholars too may give their opinions.
