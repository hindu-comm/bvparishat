Dear Sri Krishnaprasad-ji,

  

The original help sought was to give an opinion on a book by KimPlofker on Ancient Indian Mathematics.

  

Such an opinion can be given only by scholars who studied that subject.

  

Opinion giver need not be a greater expert than the author on the subject. Recommending a scholar as eligible to give opinion does not imply the claim that the recommended scholar is a greater expert than the author.

  

Opinion giving by a scholar also does not imply a claim by the opinion giver that he/she is a greater expert than the author.

  

The only point is that not every one can give opinion about such a book which requires expertise in the field to be able to review.

  

There should be no second opinion regarding the suggested scholars being at least eligible to give their opinion on the book as experts in the field.
