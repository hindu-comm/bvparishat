Dear Krishnaprasad ji,

  

As I use and recommend to many friends to use Prof. Ramasubramaniam's videos on Youtube and also spending money via [shaale.com](http://shaale.com) to learn about Indian mathematics and it's history, it would be very helpful if you could elaborate regarding the authenticity of his work. Do you ascribe the decrease in authenticity to lack of mathematics knowledge, or to lack of sanskrit knowledge?  

  

If I have seen correctly, this group comprises of mainly scholars who are expert in sanskrit and related languages, history, and similar fields. Since you are doing Math and Physics major your help will be invaluable. I think such a feedback may also be welcomed by Ramasubramaniam sir in order to improve his weak points.  

Thanking you in advance,

  

Namaskar,

Bandhavi
