In one of the recent posts on BVP regarding the obituary of Yukio Ohashi, I posted on the request of a friend , there was the following:

  

"Concerning (1) Ôhashi made a significant contribution in the study of JyotiṣaVedāṅga, criticizing David Pingree.2 Pingree thought that the number of civil days in the five year cycle (yuga) is 1825, in other words, a solar year consists of 365 days, and that this was borrowed from Egypt or Mesopotamia. But Ôhashi argued that a yuga consists of 1830 civil days and therefore a solar year is 366 days, which is purely of Indian origin. Ôhashi also rejected Pingree’s idea of Mesopotamian origin of the ratio 2 : 3 of the shortest and longest day time found in the JyotiṣaVedāṅga and other old Sanskrit texts. He showed that the ratio was derived not from the interpolation from the observation of the solstices but from the extrapolation from the observation around the equinoxes. As a result he concluded that the latitude of the Jyotiṣa-Vedāṅga is about 27-29∘ north.3"
