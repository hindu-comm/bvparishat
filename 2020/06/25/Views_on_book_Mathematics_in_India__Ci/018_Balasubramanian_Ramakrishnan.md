Just to clarify the background of this question: there’s a 50% off sale with free shipping at the Princeton University Press. I realize that this is useful for only US residents. I saw this book which seemed interesting to me. However a quick internet search revealed that she is Pingree’s student (?). As was pointed out by Prof. Subhash Kak in [https://medium.com/@subhashkak/indian-astronomy-and-the-yavanajātaka-date-fabrication-49dd83393e](https://medium.com/@subhashkak/indian-astronomy-and-the-yavanaj%C4%81taka-date-fabrication-49dd83393e)

  

The historian of astronomy Bill Mak adds in a recent paper: “The so-called Hipparchusʼ value for the length of the solar year as well as the “earliest zero” are all Pingreeʼs own emendations not attested in any extant manuscripts. This is certainly not good news, as it sounds like as if one of the most respected scholars in Indian history of sciencefabricated his findings.” \[italics added\] \[3\].  

  

That’s a pretty serious charge, more so coming from a Western scholar. I didn’t want to waste money on one more book with “everything good in India comes from Greece” racist nonsense. But it looks from the reviews that Prof. Plofker has moved away from that - at least explicitly. In any case, I have ordered the book.

  

Thanks once again.
