Respected Scholars,

  

1\. I am facing this issue with the Sansknet site, a project of RSVP Tirupati.

Only the devanagari fonts are downloadable and I couldn't download Sanskrit fonts. I tried installing devanagari but it looks like I am missing something. Can any of you help me out to install the appropriate font to read the text from the website?

  

2\. I need unicode text of Nyaya Siddhanta Muktavali (Moolam) along with dinakari and ramarudri tikas.(These are available in Sansknet but due to font issue, I am unable to download and use it) It will be really helpful if any of you could share the book.

Thanks & Regards
