माधवस्मृति - “Madhava’s Code of Conduct”

  

प्रात: पत्न्या: स्पृशेत् पादौ ब्रूयाद् “देवि, क्षमस्व माम् ।

करिष्ये नातिचरणम्” एवं कुर्वीत शान्तये ।।

  

One should touch his wife’s feet in the morning and say: “O Goddess, please forgive me. I will not do any transgressions.” One should do this to keep peace in the house.
