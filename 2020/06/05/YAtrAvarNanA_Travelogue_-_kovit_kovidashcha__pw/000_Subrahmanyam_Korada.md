नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

It is my सुहृत् , Vid Ashok Aklujkar , who suggested that it is better if a यात्रावर्णना is penned in Samskrittaking my experiences during Kovid-19 , instead of briefing in just two lines ( as I did ) . The fact is that it did not strike my mind at all - and many thanks to Vid Aklujkar for his आत्मीयता and दूरदर्शिता , which are found rarely . The fact he emphasized is - not many writings dealing with यात्रा or जीवितम् (Travelogue or Biography ) are seen in Samskrit.

Scholars, including Vid Aklujkar , may suggest any improvements .

It is exactly on this day last month I embarked on a long road journey from Gurugram (Haryana) to Hyderabad .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
