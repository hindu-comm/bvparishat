Dear Prof Korada,

I read your travelog with interest. I had a parallel experience of being stuck 10,000 miles away

from home than the 1500 miles in your case.

I do have a suggestion. The article can be edited to make it like a panchatatra educational

story with quotes and quips. An aspiring student in the list may try it out as a creative exercise.  

You can guide. Indc Academy may support if needed.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
