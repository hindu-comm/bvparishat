Long back I had compiledthe list of fauna mentioned by Valmiki, along with their botanical names ( This information is somewhere available in the Web) and passed it on to a botanist in Karnataka Forest department suggesting that a Valmikivanacould be developed. He took the list and as it happens in such cases nothing happened.

Venetia Ansell's blog is very interesting and informative.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
