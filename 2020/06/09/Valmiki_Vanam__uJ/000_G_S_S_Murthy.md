Respected scholars,

Is there somewhere a Valmiki Vanam containingall the trees, shrubs and vines mentioned by Valmiki? If yes, where? If not iI feel the country should have at least one. There are several Sanskrit Universities and some may have adequate space to develop one.

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
