Namaskars,

Valmiki described the ashoka vanam, also known as pramadA-vanam, meant for the numerous wives of Ravana. It was a part of his harem

with latA-griha-s, bowers of creepers, chitra-shala-s, pleasure houses etc. Perhaps there is nothing sacred in it. Someone,equivalent of

Ravana might be having such a thing even now .
