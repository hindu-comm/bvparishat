May not be strictly related and/or may be well-known, but I remember there were some detailed posts about various plants mentioned in various kāvya-s, on this blog:
<https://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/category/seasonal-poetry/> — for example,[śephālikā](https://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/shephalika/),[bandhūka/bandhujīva](https://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2010/11/05/bandhuka/),[mālatī](https://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2010/10/30/malati/), … all have posts dedicated to them with pictures, poems, names in Amarakośa and various languages, and botanical description. (There's a full list [here](https://venetiaansell.wordpress.com/2010/10/23/seasonal-poetry/).)

  

I imagine there may exist more such resources; hopefully someone here knows more.

  
An actual physical *vanam* may have some difficulties as different plants may grow in differentkinds of climate / soil, flower at different times etc… but perhaps these difficulties are not insurmountable; I don't know :)
