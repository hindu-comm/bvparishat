Thank you, Shankara Ji, for these video files. Just watched the first part. It is amazingly beautiful. Sometime in 1967 or 1968, during a visit to Ujjain for the Kalidasa Festival, I remember watching multiple presentations of Shakuntalam in different regional styles. One of them was a presentation entirely in the mime form directed by Vijaya Mehta, and several of my classmates from Pune had acted in it. I myself acted as Dushyanta in the Shakuntalam during my Fergusson College days. With best wishes,
