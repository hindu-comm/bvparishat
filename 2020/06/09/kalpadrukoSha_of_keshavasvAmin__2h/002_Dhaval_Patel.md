A correction -

The author is Keśava, distinct from Keśavasvāmin (the author of Nānārthārṇavasaṁkṣepa).

I apologize for the error.

Kindly note the new URL

<https://github.com/sanskrit-kosha/kosha/blob/master/kalpadrukosha_keshava/orig/kalpadrukosha.txt>

  

I extend my gratitute to the colleague who drew my attention to this error.
