Hari Om!

Namo Namah

I have a query.

**What is meant by 21 Swargas and 22 kritis?**

I downloaded the GanitaNamaMala of Haridatta,the link provided on this group.

Following are the relevant shlokas

  

|                                                      | |------------------------------------------------------| | ज्ञेयाषोडशसंज्ञावैनामस्याद्यत्रभूपतेः।         | | अथसप्तदशात्यष्टितत्रैवाष्टदशाधृतेः॥३२॥         | | **द्वाविंशतेराकृतिश्च**नखसंज्ञास्तुविंशतिः।       | | सिद्धाजिनाश्चतुर्विंशत्तत्त्वंचपञ्चविंशतिः॥३३॥ |

It's seen that after 18 he jumps to 22 directly.

  

This is required by a friend, Rajeev Velankar, son of S.B.Velankar, who has written Marathi book "Prachin Bhartiya BhowtikVidnyan"

Rajeevji is translating this book in English with a few notes wherever necessary
