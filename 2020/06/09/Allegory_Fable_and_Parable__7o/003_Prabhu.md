Thank you for the detailed response!

  

"...allegory is considered to be a kind of and as an extended aspect of metaphor" I agree.

  

It seems if metaphor is a still picture then allegory would be a movie.

I understand "samudra mathana" "puranjna upAkhyAnaM" etc could be allegories.  

  

  

BTW, Thank you for enlightening on "वाचोयुक्तिः"
