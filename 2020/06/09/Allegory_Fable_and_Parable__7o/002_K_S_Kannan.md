Your explanations, Prof. Paturi, are substantial.

  

There is no need for our heritage to have exact equivalents  

for the categories of literature another heritage has devised;

(as is also the case the other way round).  

  

To substantiate by a discussion in respect of itihasa v/s history,  

well did Prof. Srinivas Tilak (2019:65) say:

"As Thapar has observed, this move perpetrates violence against Itihāsa,  

leaving Pollock’s central thesis ‘**India is without history**’  

an ideological affront (Thapar 2013). India’s response should be:  

**So what? The West is without Itihāsa!**"

**
