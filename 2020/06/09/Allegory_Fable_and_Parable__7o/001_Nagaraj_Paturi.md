We may not have exact equivalent categorizations of narratives.

  

There are a very big number of words for categories of narratives in Sanskrit such as

  

आख्यान, आख्यायिका, ऐतिह्य, इतिहास, पुराण, वाकोवाक , वाकोवाक्य , कथा, कथानक , गाथा etc.

  

But the basis of classification for these categories is different from the basis of classification of narratives in the categories

  

allegory, fable and parable

  

Among these three too,

  

basis of categorization for allegory is different from that of fable or parable.

  

Fable and Parable have one common basis: instruction, उपदेशः Fables are small folk tales with a 'moral' कथा or कथानक with उपदेशः . Parables are narratives brought in to bring home a spiritual or ethical message as part of a conversation, can be something like उपाख्यानात्मक कथानक.

  

Allegory as a category of narrative is different from allegory as a figure of speech.

  

As a figure of speech , allegory is considered to be a kind of and as an extended aspect of metaphor.

  

In this sense, it is close to रूपकालंकारः and लक्षणा /लाक्षणिकप्रयोगः .

  

Metaphor as a figure of speech is the same as रूपकालंकारः 

  

Metaphor as an aspect of semantics is the same as लक्षणा.

  

So allegory as a figure of speech or as an aspect of semantics can be a kind of रूपकालंकारः or a kind of लक्षणा.

  

Metaphor is used in reference to words with metaphor too. lion is a metaphor in 'Shivaji is a lion'.

  

When metaphors settle down as idioms or cultural, more specifically, linguistic artefacts, they become part of वाचोयुक्तिः . They form part of a category of speech artefacts metaphor-idiom-proverb settled in and encapsulating a cultural tradition. परंपरासिद्धवाचोयुक्तिः that icludes nyaayas.

  

When a series of रूपकालंकाराः are used in a row in the same sentence, passage or a poem to describe the same entity , in such a way that the upamaanas are all connected to each other and form part of a single image just as the upamaanas are all connected to form part of the same entity, then such a रूपकालंकारः / metaphor is called an Allegory. For want of a Sanskrit term a scholar-poet in Telugu Gunturu Seshendra Sharma used the word **आरोपमु** (आरोपः) in this sense.

  

But as a category of narrative, allegory refers to works such as John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress". Interestingly, we have works like प्रबोधचंद्रोदय and संकल्पसूर्योदय in Sanskrit which are of the same kind. People have been using expressions such as रूपकप्रधाननाटक etc. for want of a readily available word for such a narrative category

  

Prof. Kannan and other scholars may help with a Sanskrit word if already used for the category of the narratives in प्रबोधचंद्रोदय and संकल्पसूर्योदय .
