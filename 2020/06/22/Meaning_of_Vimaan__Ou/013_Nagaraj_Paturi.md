Many older threads from BVP itself have been posted in immediate response to the thread.

  

Sri Satyan Sharma-ji's quote from SamaraanganaSutradhara brought in the usage in the secular context already and it was admired as a great addition to the discussion.

  

When Dr Ganesan-ji's p;ost brought the usage in temple context, the wikipedia page nevertheless taken with a pinch of salt as any wiki page is taken, is brought in not as an authoritative final word on the topic, only as one of the notes on the table , limited to the temple context.

  

Sri Jijith-ji's post too added the secular context and highlighted the flaw in the wiki page in that aspect.

  

That is how the material on the table can bring clarity to the discussion.

  

Yes, members can be alerted to beware of the problems with wiki pages. But nevertheless that source comes handy for many immediate references and is useful when carefully used.

  

Thanks for the guidance.

  

Warm regards,
