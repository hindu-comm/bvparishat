As far as I know Gopuram is different from the Vimana, especially in the Temple architecture; Gopuram is mostly the entrance tower as we find in many south indian temples; they are (can be) many whereas Vimanam is the tower above the Garbhagriha.

The garhagriha of all the installed deities have Vimanam which is worshipped.  

  

According Saiva Agama-s, the Vimana of a Siva temple also is one of the five Linga-s over which the consecrated water is poured during the Kumbhabhisheka (installation, pratishthaa).

  

In ancient Tamil literature, especially in the Tevaram and also in the Periyapuranam, we find descriptions of many palatial buildings endowed with gopura(s) and not Vimanam.

  

That is the main difference.
