Vimana:

  

 The full minimal shrine unit, covering from plinth to the spire (upanadi stupid paryantam). The term is used mainly to refer to a Dravida or southern temple type, as different from the word Prasada, which is used in the 'northern' context. (See under Prasada). It is used only in religious and never in a secular context.
