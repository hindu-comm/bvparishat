I agree with Dr.Ganesan's explanation about Vimana in temple architecture.

In this connection I like to make the following general observations. Large number of Sanskrit words are used by all of us in day to day language (kannada, tamil, hindi,telugu,...). These words may mean differently for different persons. Even within Sanskrit texts over centuries different meanings are attributed to the same words. Hence in a forum like BVP when 'meanings' are discussed it can be quite confusing, more so when Wikipedia articles of anonymous writers (journalists?) are cited. In the present case I find the article cited to be less than scholarly. The definition/explanation given for Vimana in the Glossary (I don't know by whom) is inaccurate and misleading. Today Vimana may not be practiced in secular architecture, but was it so in ancient times? There is a well known encyclopedia of Indian architecture by PK Acharya to which Ananda Coomaraswamy has added a few more terms. PFA to know about Vimana more accurately and authoritatively.

Thanks

RN Iyengar
