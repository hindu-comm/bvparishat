Dear learned members

  

In this regard, if this helps, here is a verse clearly showing the usage of Vimana as a building structure similar to Harmya and Prasada:-

  

हर्म्यैर् विमानैः प्रासादैर् अवेक्ष्य रथम् आगतम्  

  

This verse is from Valmiki Ramayana and describes the buildings of Ayodhya. When describing the buildings of Lanka, the word Vimana is used even more often. So the Vimana building structure was common to the north and south as per this reference. All of these Vimana's are mentioned as part of the secular buildings where peopleare living, especially royalty, mostly associated with palaces. This is consistent both in Ayodhya city and in Lanka city.

  

Regards

Jijith
