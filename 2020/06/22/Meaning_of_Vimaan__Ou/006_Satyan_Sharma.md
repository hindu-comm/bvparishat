Namaste Vidvans

  

In the Samarangana sutradhara, there is a mention of flying Vimanas created by Brahma, in whose likeness the temple Prasadas were created for decorational purposes.

  

So it seems that as per Samarangana Sutradhara, the temple Vimanas get their name from the flying Vimanas created by Brahma.
