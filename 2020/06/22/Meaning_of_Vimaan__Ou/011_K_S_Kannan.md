Coomaraswamy's fairly long review both criticises  

and improves upon PKAcharya.

We have few matches for the sharpness and accuracy of Coomaraswamy.

  

There have been one or two occasions when Coomaraswamy has

altered his earlier interpretations, but has openly admitted that

his understanding earlier was erroneous. His intellectual honesty

is a veritable model for scholars.
