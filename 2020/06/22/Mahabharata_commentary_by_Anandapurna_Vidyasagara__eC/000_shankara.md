Pranams to all,

  

I read in a paper by PK Gode (attached herewith), that the most detailed commentary on the Mahabharata is that of Anandapurna Vidyasagara, 14th century CE. Only a few parvas (aadi, sabhaa, bhiishma & saanti parvas) of this commentary were found and were preserved at Virendra Research Museum, Rajshaji (presently in Bangladesh).  

  

I would like to know whether his commentaries on Mahabharata were ever published?

  

I could not find any leads after searching at worldcat website and ncc volumes.  

  

regards  
shankara
