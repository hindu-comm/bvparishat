I recently came across two Tamil Brahmi inscriptions believed to be from 3rd century CE. My efforts to try to understand these two has led me to learn a little of the Brahmi script. üòä  This could be of interest to at least some members of BVP, hence posting it here.   



***Inscription 1***

This was read as: ‚Äúka·∫ìik≈ç·πüa pa·π≠·π≠a·πâ caruma (Pattan Charuma of Kazhikora)‚Äù



This was forwarded by Shri Naga Ganesan. The following is the information he provided:

  

‚Äú*The Kasargod inscription found by M. Raghava Variyar shows similar letters and may be assigned around the same date:*

*The first is KazhikORu. kazhi-kODu : modern Calicut is mentioned in this. kazhi = bayou. kODu = waterline or hill*.‚Äù



A bayou is a marshy outlet of a lake or river



***Inscription 2***



I came across the second one in a Facebook post of Shri Dev Raj.

It was read as: Parampa·πâ k≈çk≈´r ki·∫ìƒÅr maka·πâ viyakka·πâ k≈çpa·πâ ka·πáa tƒìva·πâ ko·π≠ cu·πâai (The chunai, i.e., tank, dug by Gopan Gana Devan, son of Parampan, the kizhar of Kokur.)

  

Shri Vinodh Rajan confirmed the reading is correct. Shri Suresh Kolichala sent me a related article which is an interesting read:

Tamil Brahmi does not have conjunct letters, it appears. The first inscription uses the virƒÅma sign called pu·∏∑·∏∑i in Tamil. It is a dot in Tamil Brahmi.  So, reading it becomes easier. However, it is used incorrectly in the word pa·π≠·π≠a·πâ. The reason could be that the scribe was not well acquainted with the use of the virƒÅma sign.



The second inscription completely lacks the virƒÅma sign. That makes reading tougher.



I understand that northern Brahmi such as that used in Ashokan edicts, had conjunct letters. So, non-use, if any, of the virƒÅma sign would not put additional hurdles in reading the inscriptions.
