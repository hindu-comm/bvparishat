Dear Souvikji,

  

If possible, you must contact the Lalbahadur Shastri Sanskrit Vidyapeeth, New Delhi from where I purchased two complete sets of the Mahabharata with Nilakantha'scommentary (It's not with me now as it's kept at my home) in 2009, which is very cheap too being published with the financial help of the GoI (Nag Publishers seems to have forged it just by changing the front page and inserting therein a very high price as I realised it on purchasing first a set from them).

  

  

With regards,

Niranjan Saha
