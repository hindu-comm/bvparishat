"Editorial Note:This article is part of a Series on the*purvapaksha*of Western interpretations of Āyurveda. The claims and arguments made in the paper[“Medicine and Dharma”](https://www.academia.edu/11489495/Medicine_and_Dharma)by[Dominik Wujastyk](https://ualberta.academia.edu/DominikWujastyk/CurriculumVitae)are examined with the traditional drishti.Videshi(by*drishti*) scholar Wujastyk, implies in his 2004 paper thatĀyurveda is Adharma.Prof. Wujastyk first sets up*false equivalences*between Dharma and Religion, Medicine and Ayurveda. Then, using the argument of NOMA, suggestively implies that since Medicine is not Religion, Ayurveda also cannot be Dharma. The lines of argumentation, the deliberate misinterpretations, mis-translations, manipulation of the textual context, the mis-framing of texts will be all too familiar toSwadeshi(by*drishti*) scholars. At a very minimum, Ayurveda as a*“body of text”*needs to be interpreted (*atleast by those claiming to be scholars*) and understood using the principles of*[tantra](https://www.academia.edu/12132105/Tantrayukti_-_THE_DOCTRINE_OF_TANTRAYUKTI_-_AN_ANCIENT_INDIAN_SCIENTIFIC_and_THEORETICAL_TEXT_-CONSTRUCTION_MANUAL)[yukti](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3331013/)*, and not using techniques of*videshi*hermeneutics and flaky conceptual abstractions like –*Non-Overlapping Magisteria*–*[NOMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-overlapping_magisteria)*."
