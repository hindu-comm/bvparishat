I came across this article"Vyakti and History of Rasa" by Prof. Sheldon Pollock at

  

<http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/SVimarsha/V6/c16.pdf>  

  

I tried to locate the book in which this article is included , its bibliographical information, editor's name etc.

  

Can any one help me locate it.

  

Thanks for the help in advance.
