A verse on the value of poetry:

  

गजे मत्स्ये वराहे च सर्पे सीपे च दर्दुरे।  
शङ्खे वेणौ लभन्ते यन्नवमं काव्य-मौक्तिकम्।।  
  
What is a pearl? That, which people find in elephant, fish, boar, snake, oyster, frog, conch, and bamboo, and the ninth one known as poetry.  
  
Note: I have based this verse on the 8 types of pearls in the Agni Purana. A discussion of the various categories of pearls can also be found in the books on gemology, which astrologers often refer to. The transformation of bamboo shoots into pearls through the digestive process remains a chemical mystery. Moreover: मौक्तिकं न गजे गजे.
