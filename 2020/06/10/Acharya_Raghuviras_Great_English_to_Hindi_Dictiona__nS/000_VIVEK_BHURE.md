Respected Scholars,

  

While I was searching for dictionaries, I came acrossAcharya Raghuvira's Great English to Hindi Dictionary from this post:<https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bvparishat/jE90zUN4czI/xLAABBgBYWwJ>. However, the part 3 of the dictionary was messed up with regards to page order and dictionary wasn't searchable.

  

So, I downloaded this PDFs and fixed the part 3. Also, all the files are uploaded in Dictionary folder in the link:<https://mega.nz/folder/QMNwmawK#EUIZ_BuMNaiBYkUiTP6-7w> are searchable using PDF reader. I have attached a screenshot for showing the search function.

  

The link contains two folder: Dictionary and Source. Dictionary folder has the original dictionary in split files wrt letters and searchable PDF form. Source folder contains the fixed PDFs and I have NOT made them searchable due to huge size. Please download this and share as much you can.

  

Thanks and Regards,

Vivek Bhure,

A Sanskrit Enthusiast.
