Even going through the list gave rise to a very sacred feeling. These 163 fires have been burning brightly without interruption for thousands of years!

  

सर्वेभ्यो आहिताग्निभ्यो नमः।

  

Twenty years back, I read in one magazine issued from Srisailam (the Karivena satram, most likely) that there are about 300 Ghanapathis with about fifty of them being Nityaagnihotris in the then AP. It is heartening that there has not been a deterioration in that situation. I hope we see a revival in Vedic studies across the country.

  

Thank you, Bhupal ji for the list.

  

Regards

Senani
