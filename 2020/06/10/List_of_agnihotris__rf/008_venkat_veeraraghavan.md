Dear Shri Bhupal ji

  

Thanks for the list. I had already gone through this, but these have only photos and no contact details.

I was hoping to build an online resource where people can have access to these modern paragons who live quietly performing their dharma. This may in the future help build a support network.

  

Agnihotris come in all sampradayas. Agni in fact unifies all Sanatanis.

The reason why many here seem Shaivas(Smarthas) is that these people are (probably) supported by the Kanchi mata.



Shri Sivasenani garu: (Just before lockdown) I was recently at Sankarapuram (12 Kms from Mayiladuturai/Mayavaram) a Vedic gramabuilt around the village of Katiramangalam. The Veda paatashala that aims to serve around 200 students by next July (this was a precovid expectation) will be surrounded by 108 agnihotris who will act as teachers to these students and they in turn will be supported by 300 grihastas.

The whole project is managed by one gentleman assisted by 1/2 people .

  

Much needs to be done in terms of reviving and keeping alive not just the traditions but also the spirit behind dharma.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
