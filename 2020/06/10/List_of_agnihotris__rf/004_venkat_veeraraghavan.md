Dear Smt Gauri ji, Shri Sreedhar ji and Shri Srinivasan ji

  

Thank you for your response.

  

Srinivasan ji --> If there are no privacy issues can you please share the list openly on BVP?

  

I am sure many members would like to help such great people who are working silently keeping our traditions alive. And knowledge of their existence and work is the first step towards supporting dharma.

  

Thanks and Regards,

  

Venkat
