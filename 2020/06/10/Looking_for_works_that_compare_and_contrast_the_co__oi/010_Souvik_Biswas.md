Respected Deshpande Ji,

  

I would like to inform you that I have got all documents on the comparative study of Advaita vedanta and Buddhist philosophy which you have sharedwith me and Dr. Sunil ji. My link is not working but Sunil Ji shared it with me promptly on my request. Therefore, I am highly obliged and thankful to you for your kind cooperation.

  

Indebted,
