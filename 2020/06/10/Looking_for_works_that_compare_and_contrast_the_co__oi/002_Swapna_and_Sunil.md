Dear Dr. Deshpande,

  

I really really appreciate this gesture. This set of books and papers is enough for me to get going and start the study that was nascent in my mind..

  

I am especially happy to see that you gave me relevant references that point to comparisons between the Māṇḍukya Kārikā of Gauḍapāda and Vasubandhu's Yoga-achara thoughts...  

  

Much indebted for this sharing,

  

Sincerely,

  

Sunil🙏
