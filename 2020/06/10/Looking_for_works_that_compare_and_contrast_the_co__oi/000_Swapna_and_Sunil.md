Dear preceptors,

  

I was looking for books/works/thesis that compare and contrast the concept of non-duality in the Advaita Vedantic traditionand the traditionof Buddhism.

  

The only thesis that I managed to find was the following (<https://open.library.ubc.ca/.../download/pdf/831/1.0093585/1>), but I am sure there are better, deeper studies of the similarities and differences...

  

Any help or direction most appreciated.

  

Sincerely,üôè

  

Sunil
