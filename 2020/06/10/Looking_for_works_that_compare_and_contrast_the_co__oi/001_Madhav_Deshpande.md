Hello Sunil Ji,

  

  Here is a link to seven publications that may be of interest to you in comparing Buddhism and Advaita. This is by no means a comprehensive listing, but just what I collected casually from my hard drive. The more interesting studies are comparisons between Gauḍapāda and the traditions of Yogācāra and Mādhyamika Buddhism. Also a very important text is Bhāviveka's Vedānta-Tattva-Viniścaya chapter of his Madhyamaka-Hr̥daya-Kārika. This is the earliest Buddhist discussion of Vedānta known to us, and it is roughly contemporary with Gauḍapāda. You can find this inQuarnstrom-Olle-Hindu-Philosophy-in-Buddhist-Perspective-Vedānta-Tattva-Viniścaya-Chapter-of-Bhavya's-Madhyamaka-Hr̥daya-Kārikā which I have included in my list. But my list is just a tip of the iceberg. There are many more studies, and you may find many of those in the bibliographies of the items that I have included. With best wishes,
