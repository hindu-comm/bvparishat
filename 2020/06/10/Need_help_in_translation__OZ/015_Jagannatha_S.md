Thank you Madhavavarya for citing Ramadasa's work. Thank you Ujjvalavarya for quoting Comparative Dictionary The text of Kumārapālacarita has ठगand the commentary explains it by employing the wordठक.That meansPrāk**ṛ**tahas ठग(as shown in Comparative Dictionary)  and Gujarati, ठक(Hemachandra was from Gujarat ). I request the list members who know Gujarati to clarify.(I have already quotedठक्क of Kannada which means either deceiveror thief.I think Dravidian Etymological dictionary by T.Burrow may be referred to. )
