1.Kurabaka plants are congenators of Vasanta(they bloom in Spring.) They look like relatives of Pārijāta plants (because of resemblance) and
they are surrounded by line of bees. The beeline looks like string of Manmatha’s bow.  

  

2.The women embrace the Kurabaka plant tightly like the female elephants\[embrace\] tying-post. (There was a popular belief that Kurabaka plants bloom if the women embrace them ). Beauty of the women surpasses that of kurabaka plants (?)

  

I am not sure whether I have understood the Prāk**ṛ**ta verses properly.

  

Dear Ajay, I am curious to know that why do you need translation of these two verses of Prāk**ṛ**takāvya and commentary.

S.Jagannatha
