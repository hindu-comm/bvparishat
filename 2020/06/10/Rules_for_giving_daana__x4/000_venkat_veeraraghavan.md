Dear Vidvans,

What are the rules to be followed while giving daanam?

What mantras are to be chanted while offering daanam?

We see in the Ramayana and in Mahabharata that the one desirous of daanam approaches the giver or is summoned by the giver.

Is that still the practise today?

Also can daanam be given during Surya grahana kaala?  
Are there any special rules for the same?

Thanks.

Regards,

Venkat
