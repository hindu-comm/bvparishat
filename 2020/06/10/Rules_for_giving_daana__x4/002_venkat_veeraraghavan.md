Dear Shri Bhupal ji

  

Thanks for the information.

  

I'd like to raise a few concerns if I may:

  

"The *gift should be given to one who cannot return the good or to one from whom no such return is expected.*It is necessary to be in Kurukshetra or Varanasi or any part of the world that is really sacred when one offers gifts. The time should be *during solar or lunar eclips* or an eally auspicious occasion."

  

If one observes Shri Rama's yatradaanam before setting out to the forest, some of the daana was done to friends and wives of preceptorsetc.

Although what is suggested is ideal.

  

 Most sanatanis do not go out of their homes during grahanakaala.
This is as true for the recipients as it is for the givers of daanam.

What is the protocol in such situations?

  

Is it respectful to invite such people home before grahana kaala and make the daana in one's own home?

Or is it better to go to their place?

  

"Brahmanas should be offered Vastra and fed."

  

While generally feeding people is not a problem, this becomes an issue during grahana kaala when consumption of food is nishedha. Many shishtasfast from a few hours before a grahana to a few hours afterwards.

What is to be done in such a situation?

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
