Sri Hari Kiran Vadlamani , founder of Indic Academy shared the following video sometime ago (13 May, 2020) as he faced the issue of inviting / allowing some scholars and /or activists from the platforms of Indic Academy's seminars , conferences, workshops etc.  

  

For example, there was a conference to be conducted on Indigenous Environmentalism. There are some scholars who have been articulating their views in favor of the idea that Indic traditions have environmentalist aspects. But the same scholar is found to share platforms with left - liberal scholars who are anti-Indic in their approach in issues related to say gender. There was a discussion among Indic Academy internals themselves whether to invite such a scholar to the conference or not. Sri Hari Kiran-ji said we can provide a platform to such a scholar but need not promote because of the differences that are being mentioned.

  

Similarly , when Indic Academy collaborated with another organization for theConference on 'Hindu traditions on Sex, Gender and Sexuality', IA had to do a lot of explaining regarding why IA need not have hundred percent agreement with its collaborators.

  

This video announcement by Sri Hari Kiran-ji is in that context. It clarifies regardingdistinction between Platforming and Promotion and IA's approach to dispute resolution. He says, those who have objections to what IA does, may follow a dispute resolution method in stead of abusing IA on SM platforms:
