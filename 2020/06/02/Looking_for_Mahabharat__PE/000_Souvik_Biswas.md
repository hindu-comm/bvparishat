Respected Scholars,

  

I am looking for the **Mahabharat with the commentary of Nilakantha Chaturdhuri with English or Hindi translation.** But there **i**s no publishing house to provide the same. If anyone could inform me about the availability of the edition I will be highly obliged to you.

  

Regards,
