Dear Avtar Kaul ji,

  

Thank you very much for your detailed explanation. It is quite interesting. It is also interesting that such an ancient calendar managed to be in synch with the seasons. As I understand it, other ancient calendars had to add days and even a month occasionally to be in synch with the seasons.

  

Who is this Lahiri? Is he an ancient person or a relatively modern person? I have come across the surname Lahiri among Bengalis of today.

  

"As to when these seasonal Madhu-cum-Chaitra etc. got "discarded", I will discuss it in the subsequent mail." Waiting for this.

  

Regards,

Radhakrishna Warrier
