Dear Shri Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

(Contd. from previous mail)

\< At what point of time in the ancient days were the months such as Madhu, Mādhava, Śukra etc., discarded in favor of Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyēṣṭha etc.?>

The fact of the matter is that Madhu, Madhava etc. were never discarded in the real sense of the word in favour of the (present system of) Chaitra, Vaishakha etc.! They are in fact synonyms of one another!

We have seen it already that as per the VJ and the Vedic lore, Madhu was equal to Chaitra, Madhava equal to Vaishakha and so on.

Let us see what the Vedic commentators have to say about the same.

***Taittiriya Samhita:***

Below is an excerpt from the commentary of Acharya Sayana on Taittiriya Samhita 4/4/11

  

  

![image.png](https://groups.google.com/group/bvparishat/attach/3ad818be912ec/image.png?part=0.0.1&view=1)  

A simple and running English translation of this commentary is :

“Vasanta comprises two months of Madhu and Madhava which are (equivalent to) Chaitra and Vaishakha. Vasanta is a pleasant season. Greeshma comprises two months of Jyeshtha and Ashadha. It is a pleasant season. Varsha comprises two limbs of Shravana and Bhadra. Varsha is a pleasant season. Ashvina and Kartika are the two months of Sharad ritu.
Sharad ritu is a pleasant season. Margashersha and Pausha are the two months of Hemanta. Hemanta is a pleasant season. Magha and Phalguna are the two months of Shishira Ritu. Shishira Ritu is a pleasant season”

Thus Acharya Sayana has left nobody in doubt that even in 14th century CE, the Vedic (solar or lunar) Madhu was equal to Chaitra, Madhava was equal to Vaishakha and so on! (Pl. see the attachment TS-Madhu=Chaitra)

***Shatapatha Brahmana:***

Shatapatha Brahmana, with the Samskrit commentary by Acharya Sayana and Hariswamin is available with Lal Bahadur Shastri Samskrit Vidyapeeth, New Delhi. The fifth mantra of 4/2/5 is:

तान्वै द्वादश गृहणीयात्\| द्वादश वा मासाः संवत्सरस्य तस्माद् द्वादश
गृहणीयादथोSपि त्रयोदश गृहनणीयदस्तित्रयोदशो मास इति द्वादश त्वेव
गृहणीयादेषैव संपत् \|\|

Acharya Sayana's commentary on the same is very revealing! He saysअत्रायमभिप्रायः चन्द्रमास पक्षे मासाधिक्यं भवति, सौरपक्षे तु **मेषादिराशीनां द्वादशत्वाद्द्वादशैव** मास इति तत्रैवाधिको मासोअन्तर्भवति \|

Acharya Sayana has talked about thirteen lunar months vis-a-vis**Mesha** etc. twelve solar months!

Since the Vedic lunar months are seasonal, like Madhu, Madhava etc., obviously, the solar Rashis like Mesha etc. cannot be (niraadhaar) nirayanaby any stretch of imagination!

(Pl. see attachments Shat-Brah-Adhimasa-I and II)

The 14th and 15th mantras of 4/2/5 Shatapatha Brahmana say further:  

अथातोगृहणात्येव\| उपयाम गृहीतोSसि मधवेत्वेत्येवाध्वर्युर्गृहणात्त्युपयामगृहीतोSसिमाधवाय त्वेति प्रतिप्रस्थातैतावेव वासन्तिकौ स यद्वसन्तS ओषधयो जायन्ते वनस्पतयः पच्यन्ते तेनोहैतौ मधुश्च माधवश्च\|\|

This mantra tells us about the qualities of Vasanta Ritu as to how in the Spring season herbs start appearing and the plant life flourishes, and that is why the months are known as Madhu (honey) and Madhava (pertaining to Vernal season).

What is noteworthy are the commentator Acharya Sayana's comments

**मधुमधावाविति चैत्र वैशाखौ,** ऋतु ग्रहाणां चैत्रादयो मासाःदेवता:\|
चैत्रवैशाखयोर्मधुमाधवनामधेय प्राप्तिम्दर्शयति \| एतौ उक्तौ मासौ वासन्तिकौ \|

"Madhu and Msadhava are Chaitra and Vaishakha, having the months of Chaitra and Vaishakha as their presiding deities! That is why it attributes the names of Madhu and Madhava to the months of Chaitra and Vaishakha. Both these months are that of Spring season".

In fact, we find that all the mantras of this Chapter of Shatapatha Brahmana talking about the seasonal twelve months starting from Madhu and ending with Tapasya. And they have all been equated with Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. 12 months. (Pl see attachment Shat-Brah-Madhu=Chaitra)

***Samaveda Samhita:***

Samaveda Samhita, with the commentary of Acharya Sayana has been published by Munshiram Manoharlal, Delhi.

In 4/6/4/2 it says

वसन्तइन्नुरन्त्यो ग्रीष्म इन्नुरन्त्यः \| वर्षान्यनुशरद्धेमन्त: शिशिरिन्नुरन्त्यः \|\|

A simple running translation of this mantra is:

"Vasanta is beautiful. Greeshma is beautiful. Varshaa is beautiful.
Sharat Ritu is beautiful. Hemanta is beautiful. Shishira is beautiful."

Thus all the six seasons have been qualified as beautiful.

Acharya Sayana's commentary says:

वसन्तेव चैत्र वैशाख रूपो वसन्त ऋतुरेव रमणीयः ....ग्रीष्मश्च ज्येष्ठाषाढ रूपी ग्रीष्म ऋतुरेवरमणीयः ....

Acharya Sayana has in fact, clubbed Chaitra Vaishakha with Vasanta; Jyeshtha and Ashadha with Greeshma, Shravana and Bhadrapada with Varsha Ritu; Ashvina and Kartika with Sharad-Ritu; Margasheersha and Pausha with Hemanta Ritu; Tapas and Tapasya with Shishira Ritu! And praised all of them as beautiful

(Pl. see attachments Samaveda-Vasanta=Chaitra-Vaishakha and Samaveda-Madhu=Chaitra)

                             
.................................

From the above analysis, we can safely conclude that what had been declared unequivocally by Acharya Lagadha in 15th century BCE, was confirmed by Acharya Sayana about 3000 years later in 14th century CE that as per the entire Vedic lore Madhu=Chaitra (or Chaitra=Madhu) and so on and these very Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. months have been taken as seasonal months, whether solar or lunar by the entireVedic lore.

Thus Chaitra cannot be "discarded" for the sake of Madhu, nor can Madhu be discarded for the sake of Chaitra and so on!

About Chaitra vis-a-vis Madhu etc. months as per the "fifth Veda", I will discuss it in the next mail.

Till then with regards and Jai Shri Ram!
