I had to read some Linux stuff related to my work this weekend.
Frankly, I am not a software person. I design and make hardware, and the software/firmware teams breathe soul into it.  Can the dēhi (soul/ software) perform any karma (work) without the dēha (body / hardware)? 😊  Well, it was night, and I was getting bored with the stuff I was reading and happened to turn my eyes towards the window.  Lo, resplendent in the sky was the splendid Madhu Māsa Sundara Candralēkha (beautiful crescent moon of the spring month of Madhu).

  

I think we are now past Madhu and Mādhava, the sweet months of spring, and have entered grīṣma ṛtu (summer season) by the ancient India calendar. But here in north America we are still in spring. We are in the Madhu Māsa (sweet month) for all practical purposes. Grīṣma arrives here only on June 20th this year. 

  

At what point of time in the ancient days were the months such as Madhu, Mādhava, Śukra etc., discarded in favor of Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyēṣṭha etc.? Are these Madhu, Mādhava solar or lunar months?  When these months were in vogue, was intercalation needed? Are these months (Madhu, etc.) mentioned in the Ṛg Vēda? Or do they find mention in later literature? When do we begin finding mention of Caitra etc.?

  

Coming to the word Candralēkha, can it be applied to a thick crescent approaching ardha candra (half moon)? Like the wave / particle duality of physics, I know the duality of r / l existed in ancient Sanskrit. We have both Rēkha and Lēkha, as also Lōma and Rōma. Is there a word candrarēkha?
