Dear Shri Warrier,

JaI Shri Ram!

Thanks for your interesting mail!

\< I think we are now past Madhu and Mādhava, the sweet months of spring, and have entered grīṣma ṛtu (summer season) by the ancient India calendar. \>

The ancient India calendar, known as the Vedic calendar, is the real scientific calendar as it is aligned to seasons, instead of to some "almighty" Lahiri Rashichakra, because of "Vedic" (Eh!?) astrology!

The Vedanga Jyotisham----the earliest available indigenous astronomical work of about 15th century BCE---which is sans Mesha etc. Rashis, whether so called sayana or niraadhaar niraayana--- is very clear that Shishira Ritu starts with Udagayana, the shortest day of the year, and each ritu consists of two months. Thus Shishira Ritu starts around December 21 these days and Tapas and Tapasya being the months of Shishira Ritu range from December 21 to around February 20, when Vasanta Ritu (the Spring season) starts, which comprises the two months of Madhu and Madhava! Thus Madhava ended on aroundApril 20 when the first month of Greeshma ritu, viz. Shukra started!

This will be clear from the attachment "Lahiri Vedic months" where even "almighty" Lahiri himself (or his successors!) have to concede that the Vedic months are seasonal! What is all the more ironic is that he has
clubbed even "Makara" etc. Rashis with Vedic Tapas etc. months, but he has not mentioned any where that those Rashis are (so called) Nirayana or even Sayana, there being absolutely no sidereal Rashis of twelve equal divisions as per any astronomical work, whether ancient or modern!  

\<At what point of time in the ancient days were the months such as Madhu, Mādhava, Śukra etc., discarded in favor of Caitra, Vaiśākha, Jyēṣṭha etc.?>

It was next to impossible to determine precisely the starting dates of solar months during the Vedic period. Even the four cardinal points, viz. the two equinoxes and solstices were determined by a rough estimation and that is why we find the VJ talking of a seasonal (tropical) year of 366 days instead of about 365.25 days.

That is also the reason as to why the VJ talks in terms of mean motion of the sun and the moon to determine tithi, nakshatra, months, seasons, ayanas and thereby a solar year.

But that does not mean that there were no solar months during the Vedic period because we find references to twelve adityas presiding over twelve months as per the Brihadarnyaka Upanishada 3/9/5, during the dialogue between Yajnyavalkyaand Shakalya.

But because of ease of computation of solar months also through lunar tithis, solar Madhu-Madhava got clubbed with lunar Madhu, Madhava etc. and later the lunar Madhu-Madhava got amalgamated with lunar Chaitra-Vaishakha etc.

Madhu-Madhava etc. names were thus never discarded by any astronomical work worth the name right from from the Vedanga Jyotisha through the Surya Siddhanta (the very first siddhantic work of Rashi based astronomy) to the last siddhanta of Bhaskaracharya of 12th century AD!

***The VJ is talking of seasonal Magha etc. lunar months:***

As a proof of the same, the Vednaga Jyotisha has said in the sixth mantra

स्वराक्रमेते सोमार्कौ यदा साकं सवासवौ \|\|स्यात् तदादियुगं माघस्तपः शुक्लोSयनम्ह्युदक\|\|

When the sun and the moon, coming to Vasava (Dhanishtha) star together then the yuga, the Magha month, Tapah season, the light half of the month and the winter solstice, all commence together (Dikshit's translation)

Here the Magha month is certainly lunar and Tapas seasonal-solar as presuming both of them to be either solar or lunar defeats the purpose completely!

Besides, as Shukla Paksha is supposed to start simultaneously that certainly shows lunar Magha! Thus one can safely say that the solar Tapas and lunar Magha started simultaneously when the VJ was compiled!

Now if we presume that though the month of Tapas was seasonal but Magha was "almighty" Lahiri Magha as per the Vj also, as some "Vedic astrologers" would like us to believe, that just is astronomically an impossible situation!

The VJ conditions of Udagayanacoupled with New Moon in "*Dhanishthardha*" are strictly for January 1, 1399 BCE, as will be clear from the two attachments (i)VJ-Year-1399-BC and (ii) VJ-Udagayana-New-Moon.

As it was the shortest day of the year, it was Udagayana. And the sun together with the Moon was conjunct near the beginning of *Dhanishtha*nakshatra, as the longitude of that star as per mean equator and equinox of that date was around 270 degrees.

With the Sun in Udagayana, it was the start of Tapas month and Shishira ritu. And with the New Moon also on the same date, it was the start of lunar Magha!

With the "almighty" Lahiri Ayanamsha of plus 23 degreeson that date, "Lahiri" Udagayana had already started earlier by 23 days. Hence the New Moon on that date could not be said to be of "Lahiri" Magha Shukla Paksha! It can not be that the sun is so called Sayana but the Moon conjoined with the same (i.e. New Moon) is "almighty" Lahiri nirayana!

And such a phenomenon of New Moon in Udgayana and beginning of Dhanishtha is not going to be repeated for quite some time---at least about 24000 years!

\< Are these Madhu, Mādhava solar or lunar months?  When these months were in vogue, was intercalation needed? Are these months (Madhu, etc.) mentioned in the Ṛg Vēda? Or do they find mention in later literature?
When do we begin finding mention of Caitra etc.? \>

Madhu, Madhava etc. names are interchangeablewith solar as well as lunar months whether it was in the Vedic lore or the Pauranic or siddhantic!

Taittiriya Samhita 4/4/11 says

मधुश्च माधवश्च वासन्तिकावृतू शुक्रश्च शुचिश्च ग्रैष्मावृतू नभश्च नभस्यश्च वार्षिकावृतू इषश्चोर्जश्च शार्दावृतू सहश्च सह्स्यस्च
हैमन्तिकावृतूतपश्च तपस्यश्च शैशिरावृतू \|

The meaning is very clear that Madhu, Madhava are the months of Vasanta, Shukrah and Shuchih the months of Greeshma, Nabhah and Nabhasya the months of Varsha Ritu, Isha and Urja the months of Sharat Ritu, Sahah and Sahasya the months of Hemanta Ritu and Tapah and Tapasya the months of Shishira Ritu.

The same thing has been repeated in the Shukla Yuajurveda and other Vedic lore.

Here the months Madhu, Madhava etc. are purely solar months, as there is no intercalationetc. But the same Taittiriyia Samhita 1/4/14 has said

 मधुश्च माधवश्च शुक्रश्च शुचिश्च नभश्च नभस्यश्च इषश्चोर्जश्च सहश्च सह्यश्च तपश्च तपस्यश्च उपयाम गृहीतोSसि सम्सर्पॉसि अम्हस्पत्याय् त्वा  

Here a thirteenth month "Amhaspati" has been included which is an adhika-masa (intercalary month) and therefore lunar, as solar months do not exceed the number twelve in a year!

More or less similar mantras have been repeated in Vajasneya Samhita 7.30-31 thus confirming an adhika Madhu, Madhava etc. as lunar months.

In the Vajasneya Samhita 22.30-31, we find mention of "*malimlucha*" and then Amhaspati again, coupled with Madhu, Madhava etc. months, which must obviously be lunar!

Below are given these two mantras

सं सर्पाय स्वाहा चन्द्राय स्वाहा मलिम्लुचाय स्वाहा दिवापतये स्वाहा \|

मधवे स्वाहा माधवाय स्वाहा शुक्राय स्वाहा शुचये स्वाहा नभसे स्वाहा नभस्याय स्वाहेषाय स्वाहोर्जाय स्वाहा सहसे स्वाहा सहस्याय स्वाहा तपसे स्वाहा तपस्याय स्वाहांहस्पतये स्वाहा\|

Regarding your query, "When these months were in vogue, was intercalation needed", we find intercalation having been talked about in the very first Mandala, 25th Sukta (8th mantra) of the earliest viz. the Rig Veda.

वेद मासो धृत व्रतो द्वादश प्रजावतः \| वेदाय उपजायते

(Attachment RV-Sayana-Adhikamasa), though the names of Madhu etc. months in the Rig Veda are conspicuousby their absence unlike the later Vedic lore. The commentary by Acharya Sayana leaves no doubt that the RV was talking about nothing but an adhika-masa, that too in terms of the lunar months Chaitra, Vaishakha etc. though again, these names too are not in the RV.

Even if, for the sake of argument, Chaitra etc. names have been discussed in the RV, since the year of the Vedas, including the RV, is seasonal---tropical (so called) sayana, which means the solar monthswere tropical, and it is impossible that ''almighty" Lahiri (nirayana i.e. niraadhaar!) Chaitra would have been clubbed with the seasonal solar Madhu, Madhava etc. months!

The attachment "RV-Hindi" is a translation in Hindi of the same mantra of the Rigveda, by Shivnath Ahitagni and Pandit Shankardutt Shastri, (published by Lal-Bahadur Shastri Samskrit Vidyalaya, Delhi) where the commentators have specifically talked about the (so called) Sayana rashis while clarifying the same mantra.

As to when these seasonal Madhu-cum-Chaitra etc. got "discarded", I will discuss it in the subsequent mail.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
