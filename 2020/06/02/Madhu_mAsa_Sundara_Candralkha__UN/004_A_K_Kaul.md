Dear Shri Warrier,

Jai Shri Ram!

Many thanks for your response.

\<  It is also interesting that such an ancient calendar managed to be in synch with the seasons. \>

Yes, really the Vedic calendar is the most scientific and wonderful calendar, especially since it embraces not only the seasonal solar year of the four cardinal points viz. the two ayanas and Visuhvas (Equinoxes and Solstices), seasonal months and six seasons, but the seasonal luni-solar phenomena also. On top of it, if we peruse the Vedic lore carefully, it has discussed the nakshatras (of course, sans Mesha etc. Rashis) umpteem number of times, but not the imaginary 27 divisions, which nobody (including the "Vedic astrologers" themselves) know as to where-from it starts!

\< As I understand it, other ancient calendars had to add days and even a month occasionally to be in synch with the seasons.>

There is a persian saying

ब बेगानम हरगिज़ न में नालम\| हर्चिमन करदअज़आशिना करद\|

"I have no complaints against the ones whom I do not know since whatever injustice has been done to me is by my own kith and kin!"

A feeling of disgust and aversion has been created by some of our own "scholars" towards this wonderful and beautiful calendar by presenting it as Gregorian since it talks of so called Sayana Rashis! But nobody till date, including the "Vedic astrologers" themselves has been able to produce even a shred of evidence that there is any semblance of any Mesha etc. Rashis, that too the *niraadhaar* niraayana, in any of the Vedas or the Vedangas!  

On the other hand the history of Gregorian/Julian calendar is replete with confusions to such an extent that the starting year of "Julian calendar" itself had 445 days instead of the usual 365.25 (approximate) days of a seasonal solar year! And that is why it was known as ''Year of confusions"!

Then again, in 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII ''eliminated" ten days from Thursday, October 5, 1582 to Friday, October 15, 1582, people literally wept and roamed the streets trying to find the "lost ten days"!

On the other hand, the evidence I have produced in my previous mails from the the Vedanga Jyotish, the Rigveda, Sahtapatha Brahmana, Taittiriya Samhita, Shukla Yajurveda, Krishna Yajurveda, Vajasneya Samhita, Samaveda Samhita----you name it and the evidence is there!----that Madhu-cum-Chaitra and Madhava-cum-Vaishakha are the beatiful months of beautiful Vasanta Ritu and so on, speak volumes about the intuitive knowledge of our Vedic seers!

But just see the irony! We discard all such Vedic dicta calling them as Gregorian but have adapted a hotchpotch of 27 imaginary equal nakshatra divisions, subsumed in still more imaginary 12 equal divisions of Mesha etc. Rashis---that too *niraadhaar* nirayana----which nobody knows as to whether they must use Lahiri Ayanamsha or Ramana Ayanamsha or K P Ayanamsha or Fagan Ayanamsha ---you just name it and they have it!---for the starting date of the *nirayana* year ---leave alone the months!

That is why we are not celebrating any of the festivals and the Vedic rituals, including the Rik-Upakarma or Yajusha Upakarma or Pongal or Rama Navmi or Janmashtami on correct days! Same is the case with Muhurtas! We are celebrating marriages etc. during Sharadha paksha but celebrate Pitra-Amavasya on the day of actual Dipavali!

Similarly, about nakshatras, the attachment from Shatapatha Brahmana makes it very clear, especially the commentary by Acharya Sayana that various nakshatras have unequal number of stars, which means that there is nothing like an equal division!

For example, according to it, Krittikas are supposed to have the largest number of stars and that is why it never swerved from the East, but other divisions have one or two or so on!

Quite a few Vedic mantras including those of the Atharva-Veda talk of twenty-eight instead of 27 nakshatras!  

We can only pray to Him to give *sadbudhih*to all the ''well wishers" of Hindu Dharma, for whom "Vedic astrology" is more important than anything else, including the Vedas themselves!

\<Who is this Lahiri? Is he an ancient person or a relatively modern person? I have come across the surname Lahiri among Bengalis of today.>

N. C Lahiri was the "first Indiamember of the Ephemerides-Commission of the International Astronomical Union, Paris and the First Officer In-charge of the Nautical Unit of GOI". (Attachment Lahiriv-285-Chita-zero)

He had a very good command on astronomy, both siddhantic and modern!
So far so good! But he was also a publisher of his Lahiri's Indian Ephemeris since 1939 in English, apart from some "Panchanga" in Bangla! In those days, almost all the panchangas in India were published from either Grahalaghava or Makaranda or Sarvananda Laghava and so on which are actually "handbooks" of the Surya Siddhanta/Aryabhatiya/Brahma Sphuta Siddhantas principles only as far as their calculations go, as the original siddhantas are actually following the Vedic system of solar seasonal years and months but there is a mismatch between the calculations and the astronomical principles adumberated by these very siddhantas!

The Surya Siddhanta has madeit very clear in *Triprashna-adhikara* verses 9 to 12 that as and when there is some difference between the observed results and calculations, the latter should be corrected by adjusting the difference between the calculated and the observed equinoxes and solstices so that they tally exactly with the latter! And this difference that was to be adjusted was termed as "Ayanamsha". (Pl. see attachment *Ranganatha-Ayyanamsha)*.

Some scholars say that these versesabout Ayanamsha are a later day addition in the SS after Munjala's Laghumanasa. Even if that is/was so, it means that later scholars had realized that mismatch of calculations vis-a-vis the real equinoxes and solstices and efforts had been made accordingly to remove that discrepancy!

Even the famous Varahamihira had lamented in his Brihat Samhita-Aditya-Chara because of this mismatch in the calculations (Attachment BS-RKBhat)

Anyway, the authors of Grahalaghava etc. had probably not read the SS completely or were too "lazy" to make observations and adjust the differences!

It is really ironical that a foreigner like Alberuni appreciated in 11th century the efforts of Munjal's Laghumanasa of tenth century CE for having suggested Ayanamsha corrections by adding one arc-minute per year from Shaka 444 to the mean longitudes of the SS or Aryabhatiya etc. so that they tallied with the real observations, but our own "hand-book" makers, on the other hand ignored the *Triparashnadhikara* shlokas of the SS apart from the corrections suggested by Munjal! (Pl. see attachment Alberuni-Munjal)

Even Bhaskaracharya-II of 12the century AD has talked about Ayanamsha corrections of Munjal to convert the so called nirayana into sayana, but the Makaranda and Grahalaghava etc. just ignored them---or maybe they did not even read them!---and created such a mess which was taken advantage of by people like N C Lahiri!

(To be continued)

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!
