There should indeed be a clear documentation of all these

right from the beginning,

and especially the ongoing ones.

  

This helps one to get to know the trends in choosing themes by scholars,

and funding schemes by the agencies.

Also, is there research activity pertaining to Sanskrit/Indology

funded by private agencies?

  

What kind of foreign involvement is there in making over grants for projects

\- as with Ford Foundation/Rockefeller Foundation etc.  

in various activities - of what kind (Cf. Staal's AGNI - documentation of Somayaga,

digitisation of books etc.

  

What can also be of concern is what kinds of patronage and sponsorship  

is happening in the West in terms of Grants and Projects,

and what money is spent on these expecting what results etc. ?
