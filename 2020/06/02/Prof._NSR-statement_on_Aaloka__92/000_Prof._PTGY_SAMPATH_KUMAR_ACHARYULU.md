I have successfully submitted A Critical Edition of Aaloka of Jayadeva Mishra (15 c. A.D.) a commentary on Tattvacintamani of Gangesopadhyaya, as a Major Research Project of UGC, in three volumes, totally 1200 pages in 2015.

  

Our revered Acharya Prof. NSR Tatacharya Swamy showered his blessing on me by writing this opinion at his age of 90.

  

I enclose herewith to delight the scholars.

  

Thanking You
