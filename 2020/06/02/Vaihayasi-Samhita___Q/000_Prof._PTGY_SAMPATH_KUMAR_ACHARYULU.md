Vaihayasi Samhita is a rare text ofthe Pancaratra Agama Literature.

  

This text said that thaith by Vaihayasa - Garutman to the sages Bharadvaja and others, who were conducting penance at Himalaya-s during Tretayuga.

  

I have edited this text for the first based on a single manuscript availed in grantha characters, that written in In Melkite Karnataka. In the year 1780 A.D.

  

I have presented a paper on this text entitle “ A note on Vaihayasi Samhita - an unpublished pancaratra text” in the 14th WSC, conducted at KyotoUniversity, Japan, in 2009.

  

The text is published from Rastriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha, Tirupati, 2010, in the publications of its Golden Jubilee Series, along with my introduction in English as well as Sanskrit and with pada index of verses.

  

I herewith submit humbly before the Scholars of BVB.

  

Thanking You
