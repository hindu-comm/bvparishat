The Advaita Vedanta is the pinnacle of Indian thought.According to many scholars it is the most logical system of Indian Philosophy,and the Sanskrit texts dealing with Advaiata Vedanta are the crest jewel of Sanskrit literature.What had once been a philosophy known only to the elite in India,was made available to all through out the world when Swami Vivekananda's illuminating lectures in the west on Advaita Vedanta were published.Many non-indian scholars have in recent times been fascinated by the philosophy Advaita Vedanta and have set about studying Sanskrit in earnest,though the Sanskrit language stands as a barrier to many. A Dictionary of Advaita Vedanta is a humble endeavour to help such scholars have easy access to the basic ideas of Advaita Vedanta. The Dictionary is not an encyclopedia but will be handy and should serve as reckoner to those students of Advaita Vedanta who do not know Sanskrit but understand English. This book is the fruit of combined labour of a few competent scholars,headed by the eminent Prof.Niriod Baran Chakraborty
