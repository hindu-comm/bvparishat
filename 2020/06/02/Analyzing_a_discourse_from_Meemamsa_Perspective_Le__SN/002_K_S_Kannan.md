Indeed, there must be a repository of audio/video of  

all lectures by sound traditional scholars in Sanskrit medium, that is to say.

Those who want to learn Sanskrit

\- more particularly the Sastra-s -  

must actually be spoiled for choice!

Some may be free, but others can have a price.  

  

There could also be another in the modern stream

\- of many texts, literature/sastra-s,  

explained in English/Hindi etc. etc.

  

The professor's face must be visible now and then, or in a small window in a corner,

but the textual content (along with clarificatory Tables and Charts etc. in abundance)

must be displayed in abundance.
