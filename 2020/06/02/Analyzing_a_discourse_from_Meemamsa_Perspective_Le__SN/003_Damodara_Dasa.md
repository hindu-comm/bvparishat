Hare Krishna.  
  
I attended the first cycle and would like to write a few words of  
appreciation in this conference. I would also like to recommend others  
to attend it.  
  
I am new to mimamsa principles and do not systematically know much  
sanskrit, what to speak of knowing nuances of grammar. However, I  
found it much easier to understand although not a single word was  
spoken besides sanskrit; it was Acharya's expertise that he could  
explain complex philosophical concepts to a person like me in a  
language which I practically don't know. So I would sugget not to  
hesitate joining the course knowing that it is in sanskrit only.  
  
I have benefitted a lot from this course, getting basics of mimamsa  
and am looking forward for the next level course (2nd level) wherein I  
think we will be given more hands on training by applying principles  
we learnt on different sastras (the thing which we did in last two  
sessions of level-1 course).  
  
I feel that now I would be able to read standard books on mimamsa like  
Ganganath Jha's Purva-mimamsa in its sources, or Sabara Bhasya, etc.  
and there will be much help in understanding them.  
  
Zoom classes are well recorded and managed; hasslefree viewing and  
materials are well made. Punctuality is very well maintained. Every  
class started to the accuracy of one minute and ended as well  
accurately.  
  
Looking forward to registering and attending next level of mimamsa workshop.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,  
damodara das
