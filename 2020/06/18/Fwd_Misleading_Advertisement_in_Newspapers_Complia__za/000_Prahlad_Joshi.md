Subject: Misleading Advertisement in Newspapers & Compliance Report Submission - India Rankings 2020  
To: India Rankings \<[no_r...@nirfindia.org]()\>  

  
  

Dear Sir/Madam,



It has been observed that many Ranked and non-ranked Institutions are advertising in the newspapers and magazines highlighting the categories and ranks which are not been announced by NIRF and misleading the general public, students, parents and other stakeholders.



The following observations have been made after reviewing advertisements published by many institutions:

1.  Institutions are highlighting state wise or district wise ranks
    whereas NIRF does not publish ranks in state-wise or district wise
    category. 2.  NIRF does not have categories like private institutions, government
    institutions, self-financing, not for profit etc. 3.  Some of the institutions have mentioned the rank on their website
    but they have not mentioned the year they were raked in. 4.  Institutions falling under Rank Band are also providing ranks while
    advertising whereas NIRF has not provided any rank to institutions
    under Rank Band. 5.  As per the State Emblem of India Act, 2005, no person can use the
    emblem or any imitation in a manner so as to create an impression
    that is associated with or/and official document of the central
    government as the case may, without permission of appropriate
    government. No person can use the emblem for commercial purpose or
    as a part of patent tittle, trademark or design except in cases as
    specified by the central government. 6.  Some of the institutions are ranked by private players and NIRF as
    well. They are displaying private player’s ranks with the logo of
    NIRF.

****

**Advisory**

1.  Provide appropriate category and exact rank in that category. Do not
    bifurcate ranks state wise or district level. 2.  There are no such categories as private institutions, government
    institutions, self financing, not for profit etc. Do no create
    additional categories or disciplines and rank your institutions in
    these self made categories. 3.  Institutions falling under rank band should highlight only the rank
    band in which they fall.



Kindly find attached the Compliance Report Format to be filled and duly signed and stamped by head of institution and send it to [nir...@nirfindia.org]() by 22nd June 2020.



Institutions are requested to comply with the above mentioned advisory. Post this mail, if any institution is found to advertise misleading advertisement or publish misleading information on their website will be debarred from future ranking exercise.



**Regards,**

**NIRF Secretariat**
