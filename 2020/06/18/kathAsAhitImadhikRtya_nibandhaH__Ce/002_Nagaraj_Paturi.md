The title " कथायाः कथा " is quite fashionable and contemporary. Titles like " The story of story" are found in the contemporary English books.

.  

A very important area not much explored in the contemporary writings of Alankara Shastra.

  

I had to delve in my PhD and later in my career for folk narrative research both.  

  

Has a lot of contemporary relevance in terms of corporate and techno applications of Indic knowledge Systems too.  

  

Congratulations, Prof. Sundareswaran.
