Pranam to all scholars,

  

We see in temple sculptures and so on that female warriors existed at least in some times in history. Are there any feminine warriors, either human or vanara, who are mentioned in ramayana? Similarly any female warriors in Mahabharata?

  

My doubt is for specifically for reference from Ramayana, Mahabharata, or the main Puranas.

  

I think Tataka is one example of a rakshasi who was a warrior, is it a suitable example? Are there other rakshasis who were warriorswho fought in the wars?

  

Thanks to all in advance and namaskar,

Bandhavi
