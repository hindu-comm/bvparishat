Prof. Siddharth Y. Wakankar,

Jai Shri Ram!

\<Prof. Kannan, it is a very bright instance of ArtificialIntelligence in the post of Shri Kaul ji. A fine reply to your spontaneous and expressive reaction.Enjoyable.>

PerhapsGoogle spell-checker could not find anything like *"shoorpa-nakhaa*" in its "AI collection" and that is why it jumped to the closest "sroopnakha" and "saroopnakha" resembling शूर्पणखा !  

That is why I usually avoid replying through mobile "keyboards" since
it creates embarrassing situations quite often!

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
