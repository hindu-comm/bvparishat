Dear All

Pranama-s.

In Ramayana we can find Kaikeyi might be considered as female warrior, who has been said as helped to Dasaratha in the battele of Deva-s with Sambarasura, for which she had been granted 2 boons.

In Mahabharata, Ambika has taken another birth as Sikhandin inorder to kill Bhishma and considered by Bhishma as female warrier, so that he has abonduned his wepon in the battlefield.

  

In Mahabhagavata Purana, we can find Satyabhama as a fimale warrier, who has killed Narakasura.

  

  

I think Tataka, Surpanakha, Lankhini, Putana, Hidimba such are only demon with some extrarfinary mistic powers, but not considered as warriers.

Thank you

Prof. Sampathkumaracharyulu PTGY
