Sincere thanks to all scholars for kindly offering references and hints.

  

Adding to Ujjval ji's quote from Rgveda, there is also नलायनी/मुद्गलानी/इन्द्रसेना who was fighting/charioteering (ऋ.१०.१०२), and the very famous विश्पला (१.११२, १.११६, १.११७, १.११८, and १०.३९).

Thank you Megh ji for bringing up the question of motive/purpose. To clarify at outset, no -isms here!

  

The general lack of knowledge about our own history, culture, traditions and literature among me and my friends often brings up such questions, and I was just generally looking for directions and references to learn more.

  

This question in particular and this timing is due to the recent Feb 17 ruling of Supreme Court of India that women can become army commanders, recent discussions and pleas to give military training for self defence to kashmiri pandits who may hopefully have some non-zero chance to return to their homeland in future, and viewing of a talk about Srirangam temple of Tamil Nadu (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meqAyWvwEP0>) in which the speaker showed some scultpures depicting female warriors, which led to more searches by me and friends about similar depiction of female warriors in sculptures, art, and music/ballads.

  

So basically I want to learn about our traditional view and recommendation of स्मृति and धर्मशास्त्र regarding martial/combat training for females, through examples and with help of the सुहृत्सम्मित and कान्तासम्मित texts.

  

And finally Prof. Wakankar ji's statement brings a crucial point :  
  

> It seems in olden days,ladies also were given military training for > self.defence.  

  

and we are all wondering how to take inspiration from our ancient and long culture to tackle current situation of women's safety in India, with respect to specific dimension of women's training for self defence.

  

  

Hope that clarifies!

  

Namaskar,

Bandhavi
