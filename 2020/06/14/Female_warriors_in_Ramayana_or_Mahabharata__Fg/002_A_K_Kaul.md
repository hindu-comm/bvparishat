Jai Shri Ram to all the members!

If rakshasis also are to be taken as female warriors, then we have Sroop-nakha, Surasa, Lankini and Trijata from the Ramayana, Pootana from the Bhagavata, Hidimba from the Mahabharata and also Karkati from Yoga Vashishtha!

Saroopnakha tried to kill Lakshman, Surasa and Lankini tried to kill Hanuman, Trijata helped Sita, Pootana tried to kill Krishna, Hidimba killed her own brother Hidimb to save Pandavas and marry Bhima.

Karati used to kill people before attaining Brahma jnyana.

With regards and Jai Shri Ram!

A K Kaul
