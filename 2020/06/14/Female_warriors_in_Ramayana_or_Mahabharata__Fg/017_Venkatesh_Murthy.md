Namaste

  

In one old Telugu film there is a scene when Subhadra and Abhimanyu are attacked by Ghototkacha in the forest. He does not know they are related to him. At that time he makes Abhimanyu unconscious. Subhadra takes up the bow and arrows and is ready to fight. That means she is a warrior.
