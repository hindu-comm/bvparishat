Dear all भारतप्रणयिनः,  
  

We, the team Amrita Darshanam, are humbly presenting the 16^(th) issue of SAMVIT (संवित्) (A bi-annual magazine of India's culture and knowledge traditions, published by Amrita Darshanam – International Centre for Spiritual Studies). This, along with the previous issues, can be downloaded from-
[amrita.edu/ad/samvit](http://amrita.edu/ad/samvit)

The current issue of SAMVIT consists of articles on काव्य, शास्त्र, इतिहास, वैद्यक and many more themes pertaining to Bhārath. Amma’s (Mātā Amṛtānandamayī Devi, Chancellor, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham) words on COVID-19, interview of Prof. Sarojā Bhāte and the invited articles from distinguished scholars of various institutes have added to the beauty of 16^(th) issue of SAMVIT.   

Your comments and suggestions are welcome!

  

Thank you!
