Dear BVP Colleagues,

  

My Sanskrit teacher, Pt. N. N. Bhide, used to point to two lines from different stotras to illustrate the problem of yatibhaṅga:  
  
१) निरालम्बो लम्बोदरजननि कं यामि शरणम्  
  
In this line the yati splits निरालम्बो लम्बो / दरजननि  
  
२) निराधारो हा रोदिमि कथय केषामिह पुर:  
  
In this line the yati splits निराधारो हा रो / दिमि  
  
To Pt. Bhide, the split in लम्बो / दरजननि was relatively more acceptable compared to the completely unacceptable रो / दिमि. Ideally, he was not happy with either. You can see an acceptable break in  
  
महैश्वर्यं लीलाजनितजगत: खण्डपरशो: \[महैश्वर्यं लीला / जनितजगत: / खण्डपरशो:\]

  

Are there any other examples of serious यतिभङ्ग in the known Sanskrit literature?  

  

With best regards,
