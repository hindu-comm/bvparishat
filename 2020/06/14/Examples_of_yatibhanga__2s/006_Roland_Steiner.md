Dear Madhav,  
  
In a chapter of my 1997 book on Harṣadeva's Nāgānanda and Indian  
drama, I examined the use of caesurae (yati) in Harṣa's three plays.  
Although it is written in German, you can at least see from the  
Sanskrit passages quoted which particular forms of caesurae I came  
across (see appendix, esp. pp. 245-247).  
  
Among these verses there is also a Śikhariṇī:  
  
samantād āpānotsavam anubhavantīva madhupāḥ (Nāgānanda 3.8d)  
  
Best wishes,  
Roland
