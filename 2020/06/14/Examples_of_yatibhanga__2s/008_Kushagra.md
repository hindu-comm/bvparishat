This seems to be a common feature of some verses in the शिखरिणी meter. There are multiple instances in Gangalahari:

  

मृगास्तावद्वैमानिकशतसहस्रै:

न काका नाकाधीश्वरनगर...

  

I see a couple of instances inशिवमहिम्नस्तोत्रम् as well.

  

Other prominent compositions in this meter may be illustrative.
