Dear Shri Radhakrishna ji

I got a certain impression from your posts. Looking at your photo I realise you are advanced only in scholarship and not age.. ;-)

Allaama prabhu was frequently associated with Gorakhnath too sometimes as disciple and sometimes as Guru.

The statute for secrecy starts from Vamana...maunam sarvaartha saadhanam.  
It continues with Rama....aatmanam maanusham manye raamam...

But when it comes to secrecy even the Shaivas can learn from the Shaaktas who take secrecy to a different level.  
A friend in Bangalore who belonged to the Guhananda mandali told me that his guru in kanchi advised him to keep the mantra of Sri Devi as a kula vadhu....or a kula stri. One would not bestow one's daughter on a wastrel so also paatra shodana is essential before something can be poured in.  
Praana is secret. When something is kept secret the sense of adoration and the quality of praana invested is much higher than with something exposed and in common usage. This ofcourse puts in perspective all the cassettes released singing the gayatri. The sacred has been forced onto the streets and dvijas are turning their back on the anushthana of Gayatri.  
The other issue is the nature of speech and expression itself. Each externalised type of vaak starting with paraa opens itself to partial expression losing something in the process. Vaikhari or action exposed to all suffers from loss of focus and opportunity for semantic replanting...an artform perfected by modern leftist faux liberals.

Also what is being sought in yoga is in the opposite direction of ahamkara. ..anything exposed builds ahamkaara while that which is hidden whittles away at it.

This is why paraa and secrecy are valued so highly.

I have a lot of respect for Sri Ramanuja, but he may have missed a trick in democratising the ashtaakshari and shouting from rooftops.  
And again maybe that is what is required in this age. That people recognise the sacred in the common and drag it back into the sacred space.

Regards...

Venkat
