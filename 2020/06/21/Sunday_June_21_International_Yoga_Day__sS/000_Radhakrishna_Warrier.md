Svātmārāma Sūri’s Haṭhayoga Pradīpika is considered as an authoritative work on Haṭha Yoga. I read Haṭhayoga Pradīpika a long time ago with the original Sanskrit and its English translation. There was very little information about Svātmārāma Sūri in the book. In what time period did he live? Was he a follower of the Nātha Sampradāya?

  

He mentions the following pūrva sūris:

  

कानेरी पूज्यपादश्च नित्यनाथो निरञ्जनः।

कपाली बिन्दुनाथश्च काकचण्डीश्वराह्वयः॥

अल्लामः प्रभुदेवश्च घोडा चोली च टिण्टिणिः।

भानुकी नारदेवश्च खण्डः कापालिकस्तथः॥



Muslim sounding names like Allāmah and vernacular sounding names like Ghoda, Choli, Tintini etc., seem to indicate that he lived in the post Muslim invasion era and probably during the time when Apabhramshas had already evolved into modern Indo Aryan languages.



After mentioning these pūrva sūris, he says:



इत्यादयो महासिद्धा हठयोग प्रभावतः।

खण्डयित्वा कालदण्डम् ब्रह्माण्डे विरचन्ति ते॥



These great masters, having broken the sceptre of death (kāladaṇḍa) are roaming in the universe (brahmāṇḍe viracanti te).



So, does it mean that Haṭha Yoga allowed them only to break the sceptre of death, but not to become one with the Ultimate Reality? They are still roaming in the universe.

  

Svātmārāma also says:  



गोपनीयम् प्रयत्नेन यथा रत्न करण्डकम्।

कस्य चिन् नैव वक्तव्यम् कुलस्त्री सुरतम् यथा॥



Why is this insistence on secrecy? And why such an upama ("कुलस्त्री सुरतम् यथा")? 

  

Tomorrow is International Yoga Day.

Wish you all health and peace of mind.



Below is me doing the Bakasana seven years ago when I was living in Canada.
