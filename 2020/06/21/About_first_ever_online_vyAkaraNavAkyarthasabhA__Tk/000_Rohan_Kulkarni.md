Respected Scholars,

Namaste,

We are glad to announce that we have organised five online Vyākaraṇavākyarthasabhā till now. This uncommon event began on the first Sunday of February 2020 when the first ever online Vākyarthasabhā was organised in the presence of around six scholars widespread all over India. Medium of sabha is Free Conference Call. It happens on any Sunday of every month. The duration is of two hours. Two scholars speak for about one hour (including the discussion) on the topics discussed in the texts such as Prauḍhamanoramā, Laghuśabdenduśekhara, Paribhaṣenduśekhara, Mahābhaṣya, etc. Questions are raised and an attempt is made to solve them. Entire conversation is in Sanskrit.

We warmly welcome the scholars of Vyākaraṇa to actively participate in this event and enrich the wisdom of Vyākaraṇa. We have formed a 'whatsapp' group for the announcements. Please join the group through the following link:

Yours sincerely,

Rohan Achyut Kulkarni,
