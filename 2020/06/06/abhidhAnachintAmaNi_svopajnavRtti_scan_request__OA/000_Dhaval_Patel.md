Respected scholars,

If anyone of you has a good quality scan of the above mentioned book, kindly share it with me. The scans which I got from Digital library of india or [archive.org](http://archive.org) are very poor quality scans. Anusvaras and visargas are all gone. Letters are barely legible.  

I am more interested in the commentary part of it. I have the mUla text from other sources / commentaries.
