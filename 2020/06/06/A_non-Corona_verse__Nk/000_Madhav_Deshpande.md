A non-Corona verse

  

तेषां मृगाणां मृगतृष्णिकेति

तृप्तोदरास्ते प्रवदन्तु सन्त: ।

तृष्णाममीषां शमयेत् कदाचिन्

मेघो नभस्स्थ: करुणाजलार्द्र: ।।

  

Let the gentlemen with satisfied belies say that those deer are running after a mirage. Perhaps, a cloud in the sky, wet with the water of compassion, will satisfy their thirst.
