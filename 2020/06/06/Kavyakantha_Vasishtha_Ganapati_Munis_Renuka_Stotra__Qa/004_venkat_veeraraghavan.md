Dear Sir

We call Her Ellai-amman here in Tamilnadu. Ellai meaning limit/ boundary.  
She is consequently a guardian deity of sort and approached for protection.

While she is mostly identified as Shri Parashu-Rama's mother and the head is a reference to Parashurama cutting off his mother's head at the command of his father, she is also identified with the tantric goddess Chinnamasta.  
Do you think such identification is valid based on the only commonality of a secered head?  
Thanks...  
Venkat
