The spoken language in Gurukula is Sanskrit.

Due to Covid conditions they are facing financial problems:

  

I received this facebook message:

  

Dear All,

Amount received from Vidya shree

Bank transfer

Rs 2000/-.

The above amount is received from Vidya Shree.

She is working in Delhi Public School teaching Sanskrit . She has carved herself a good merit and credit in the Organisation.

Dear Vidyashree,

Thanks a lot for your kind Guesture.

Dear All,

Presently due to Carona pandemic ,Gurukula is passing through tough times.

The problem is Gurukula runs on the rental amount received by us. Now due to Carona , people are not paying rent due to their own problems. We can't force them.

This is a big financial problem we are facing for the time being.

We have cut short the excess staff and did all cost cutting efforts. Yet not possible to meet the costs.

After voluntary donation received from Vidyashree it striked me as to why not involve our X students to contribute what is possible and feasible with in their reach.

So in this back ground now an oppertunity has come to you all to extend your helping hand to Your Gurukula .

This is needed for this academic year by which time things should come to some normal position.

Circulate this to your known gurukula friends

Hope you will try your best.

Shubham.

Agraja

Pramod R Kamat.

  

They are appealing to their own students. ![image.png](https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/zB-lLYe__Q1Ms-8j04xi9f_q-wPYeENiUuFdAhYOA4zfdA1KjANlbvNMOPNxb9Jn5ghaQDq0T9kmQ3bMSbstlaYCTupQou3hboiGhMZ0hYT-h8fSGa_NAKzYttJMz5zC0X6r4dhRakxdFmcmZmXAj6yzw0bkXoV2Fkjjkk5WSFKZOslNHHqhBepBeaYUtHhbs2gcttk93sx_W7SG_Xr5OWmLNVlyig-kzScqYsOmQ18IuWIuLw44-8CoGpFCvjpEhR-fmaETeKdvA17aEXpyT2Hr8Tax9HHLVW4xk8D4ccZU6hrijgOLWfZ7qefDUVNnWitgQYrezqmE5u-9AVXkCdkwZrU5jkD0et6w3o16cvHdmevJ16j6v7wHIN8GGGQrLgYw455Izte5DktxMYmb-QRBgkS_QeNE_XiQk2IkW_xF6NFKGoO7Ug=s0-d-e1-ft#https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&ik=ad2035ea3e&attid=0.1&permmsgid=msg-a:r4297172986013922866&th=17289334fc62d31a&view=fimg&sz=s0-l75-ft&attbid=ANGjdJ_1PDDl4Tc-bvHrQxFIlyPAlkeOW-dZ-_ZT2RJ54hVPRdRkJYx8wlSCiJ-PlAbxdaPPT2QBktAI57v7W44sUrFva6TfeaC7yrWkCA7tkux4atHC3EsvH5G01BI&disp=emb&realattid=ii_kb3hznnd0)
