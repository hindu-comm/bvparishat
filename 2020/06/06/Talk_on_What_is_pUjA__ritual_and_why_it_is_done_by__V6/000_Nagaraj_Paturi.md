Brief about Topic:  
The term pūjā (पूजा-पाठ) is highly misunderstood word in today’s world. We regularly visit temple and do worship deities at homes. If some kid comes and asks us what it is, we don’t have a proper answer. Not only the worship, we club all kinds of rituals and term all of them as pūjā . We think the marriage process is also some kind of pūjā performed by a pandit.

  
Many Yoga practitioners/meditators consider themselves as spiritual persons. Therefore, rituals or pūjā are useless or inferior activity in their opinions. There are some others who read many spiritual books and talk about enlightenment etc, but at the same time, they consider rituals as an activity of ignorant people or related to cultural identity. People who consider themselves as above religion, perceive rituals as religious activity. The American Ideas likes I am spiritual but not religious are becoming popular among Indians. Thus there are multiple perceptions, opinions and misunderstandings about pūjā or rituals.

  
This talk is an attempt to provide basic introduction to Hindu Rituals and their purpose.  
  
International Institute of Vedic Sciences is promoted by Vedavyasa Bharati Trust, USCEFI and Yoga Brotherhood of America with the blessings of Poojya Guruji Dr. Vedavyas.
