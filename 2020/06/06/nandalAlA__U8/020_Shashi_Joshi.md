Just to add few more spins -

  

1\. The word à¤²à¤¾à¤²à¤¾ in Sanskrit means the excess saliva that drools from a baby/child's mouth. In Hindi it is à¤²à¤¾à¤° as in à¤²à¤¾à¤° à¤Ÿà¤ªà¤•à¤¨à¤¾ , and from that also comes à¤²à¤¾à¤²à¤¾à¤¯à¤¿à¤¤ à¤¹à¥‹à¤¨à¤¾ , to want something so much that one starts drooling.

  

2\. All lullabies have à¤²à¤¾ à¤²à¤¾ à¤²à¤¾ etc, even in English. When vocalists are filling in (just along the tune without the song lyrics), they simple trail off into lala (land? ðŸ˜€)

So many famous songs we can all think of.

ik din bik jayega, maaTi ke mol

jag mein rah jaayenge, pyaare tere bol

Laa laa, la lull al laa ...

3\. The merchant, sitting like a hawk in his shop, is also called laalaa.

  

  

  
Thanks,  
Shashi
