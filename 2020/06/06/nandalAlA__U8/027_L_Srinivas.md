I had missed this.  

  

After his father died, Bharatiyar spent 5 years of his youth in Banaras with an aunt. That would be \~1898-1903. He learnt Hindi and Sanskrit while in Banaras. He taught himself Bengali also at this time. It's not clear how much Bengali he managed to learn however. His Banaras sojourn was a turning point in his life. The way he looks in pictures now are all part of a transformation that he underwent then - twirled moustaches, north Indian style dhoti, turban etc.. He dressed and looked nothing like a Tamil Brahmin but rather like a fiery patriot from the Hindi speaking areas.  

  

He wrote a long poem on Guru Gobind Singh (several times translated into Punjabi), on Dadabhai Nauroji etc. He used a few easily understandable Hindi words when it suited him. Elsewhere he has used 'hindustaanam' for India in a children's verse. Today it sounds odd, given how even in Hindi, 'Bharat' has almost completely replaced 'Hindustan'. Otherwise, he has mostly used 'Bharatham' for India.  

  

Milton Singer maybe somewhat irrelevant for an understanding of Bharatiyar. Singer wrote about RadhaKrishna bhajana which was a product of the 18th century Thanjavur cosmopolitan milieu which had a mixture of Marathi, Telugu, Kannada influences superimposed on Tamil singing traditions. Their singing style may have been influenced by all manner of itinerant sadhus, pandits and singers who came to Thanjavur at that time.  

  

Bharatiyar was from much further south, had nothing to do with anything passive like bhajans and he was forward looking, to a fault. He wouldnt even look at the 19th century if his life depended on it. He got his inspiration from figures of the national movement from Bengal, Punjab, Maharashtra (he wrote verses on Lal Bal Pal) and the rest of northern India. He did like Shelley's poetry - he wrote magazine articles under the pen name 'Shelleydasan'. His poetry was clearly influenced by the national movement but his vocabulary very little so. He sought to liberate Tamil poetry from its classical burden and give it a new and modern idiom - a project in which he largely succeeded. After him, nearly no serious poet wrote poetry anymore in Tamil in the 19th century form.  

  

Hope this helps,
