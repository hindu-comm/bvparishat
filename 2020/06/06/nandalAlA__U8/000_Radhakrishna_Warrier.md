[TABLE]

  

Kākkai ciṟakiṉile Nandalālā, niṉṟaṉ 

Kariya niṟam tōṉṟutaiyē Nandalālā …

  

காக்கை சிறகினிலே நந்தலாலா, நின்றன்

கரிய நிறம் தோன்றுதையே நந்தலாலா…

  

In the wings of the crow, O Nandalala (son of Nanda = Krishna)

All I see is your dark complexion, O Nandalala …

  

Subrahmaṇya Bhārati has added to the sweetness of the poem by calling Lord Krishna Nandalālā. I don’t think Nandalālā is Tamil. Or Sanskrit. Or even Prakrit or Apabhramśa. I believe it is modern Indo Aryan. In Hindi, Nandaālā means Nanda’s dear or Nanda’s son who is Lord Krishna, as in “Yaśōmatī maiyā se bōlē Nandalālā…”.  Here, I believe lālā is cognate with lāl meaning dear, son, red, etc.



Is there a cognate of lālā or lāl in Sanskrit, the different Prakrits or Apabhramśas?

  

On a different note, the word niṉṟaṉ as in “niṉṟaṉ kariya niṟam” in the song is niṉ + taṉ meaning “your” (taṉ means belonging to, of self, etc.). In a previous post, I had spoken of l + dental t becoming alveolar ṯṯ in Malayalam.  In this case ṉ+ dental t is becoming alveolar ṉṟ whose ancient pronunciation must have been an alveolar ṉḏ although its modern Tamil pronunciation is ṉḏṟ.
