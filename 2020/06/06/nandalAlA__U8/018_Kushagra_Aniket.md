Dear Members,

  

लाड़in Hindi is of Prakrit origin. The widely prevalent transformation of ड to ल may explain the origin of लाल. The elongation of ल is likely due to लोकाचार since it is common in Braj and Awadhi.

  

"लाल" at least dates back to medieval Hindi since it is very common in the works of Tulsi and the Ashtachhapa (अष्टछाप)poets of Pushti Marga. It is also commonin the compositions of Swami Haridas, which would make the word even older. For instance, see the following pada of नौका-विहार-लीला, which takes place in the month of Jyeshtha:

  

"राधे प्यारी चलि आली रसिक लाल मिल फूलन नाव सजाई"

  

Best,

Kushagra
