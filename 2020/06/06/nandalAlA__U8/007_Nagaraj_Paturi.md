This word is almost onomatapoeic. There is the Hindi word लाड meaning pampering too. लल , ललना, ललिता, लाल, ललित , लालन, लालित ......

  

That softnessof ल . Reduplication of that. It gives the feel while pronouncing and hearing. Caressing, pampering comes out of it.

  

Cute word to address /talk about the cute little.
