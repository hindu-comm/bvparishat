But Nandalaala is certainly a very interesting historical observation. Such an impact of a Hindi word on Tamil by the time of Subrahmaṇya Bhāratiitself is interesting. It can not just be attributed to the national movement and the movement organization( not the present mutated political party) Indian National Congress. Milton Singer worked on Radha Swamy movement in Chennai. We see an influence of Mira Bai Bhajans and other Hindustani Bhajan singing styles on Tamil musicians. It should have got to do with some developments of that kind.
