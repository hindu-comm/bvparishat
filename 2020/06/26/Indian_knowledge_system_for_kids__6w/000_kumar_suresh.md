Respected Scholars,

 I am able to understand and appreciate the traditional Indian knowledge system/ Sanskrit bases education through various courses at university level offered by National universities. But, I am unable to find the right link from the school level or the starting point for kids of age 5 years, so that they would continue this traditional education from the beginning. I am not sure if every child is eligible to join Veda pathasaala, as there are certain prerequisites to be fulfilled. Kindly throw some lighton this. Thank you foryour time and consideration!
