Respected Scholars,

In this connection, I would like to add the contribution to the Indian Education by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev (even though I know very little about it), who in my opinion needs no introduction. I have given a link, for those who wish to have a look at it ( <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQbNb8qb7zs>). It is not surprising to me if some of your siblings/children/grandchildren are already part of it (Isha Samskruti). Please provide your valuable comments on this if you have any. Thank you!

  

With best regards  
Suresh
