Dear Sri Kumar Suresh

  

That’s an interesting question. However please note that in the Veda pathashalas they will teach memorization of vedas not vedaa\~Nga. Even performing rituals is by an apprenticeship after this. There are Sanskrit colleges, but they target a different age group obviously.
