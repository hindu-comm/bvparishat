A girl's question to an astrologer

  

ज्योतिर्विदं द्रष्टुमगात् कदाचित्

कन्या “भवेत् को वर” इत्यपृच्छत् ।

“श्यामोऽस्तु गौरोऽस्तु न मेऽद्य चिन्ता

वरोऽस्तु मेऽसौ गृहकृत्यदक्ष: ।।

  

A girl went to see an astrologer and asked: “Who will be my husband? Today, I don’t care if he is dark or fair. But he must be dedicated to doing the housework.”
