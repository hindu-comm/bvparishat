It is derived from the word रंगवल्ली .

  

 रंग = platform , here front-yard, floor etc., of a house.    
वल्ली = creeper

  

The powder drawings looking like creepers spreading in curvedfashion are referred to as creepers (drawn) on the floor here.

  

Among south Indian languages, Kannada uses this Sanskrit borrowing while the words m(r)uggu in Telugu and kolam in Tamil are des'ya / native words.
