A helpful table classifying the variations from wikipedia:

It appears that the restrictions on shloka were less strict in the epics than in the classical period. For example, I realized that even सर्वत्र लघु पञ्चमं is not universal, as I was just reading this verse from the Gita (18.13):

  

पञ्चैतानि महाबाहो कारणानि निबोध मे।  

सांख्ये कृतान्ते प्रोक्तानि सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम्।।

  

We were just discussing this matter on Twitter when somebody came up with the verse:

  

जन्मना न हि कर्मणा जायन्ते कवयः खलु।  
श्रमेण केवलं न खरो भवति हयो भुवि।।  

  

As you can see, the above is still a shloka as it follows the rules of the shloka. The software developed by Sreevatsa ji and his colleagues is flexible enough to take this into account:
