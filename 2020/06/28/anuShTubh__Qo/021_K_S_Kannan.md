Dear Kumar-ji,

  

When it comes to handling Proper Nouns of non-Sanskrit origin,

the easy and good way out is to add some general honorific like -*mahodaya,*

and handle it as an *akArAnta* word. The problem comes when you are handling

the name of a scoundrel/criminal, to whose name you will be disinclined to

add any honorific. In such cases, one may handle it by adding -*abhidhaH/-abhidhA,*

*-nAmakaH/-nAmikA/-nAmnI* and be done with it.  

  

Another way to circumvent the problem is to make the word *akArAnta/AkArAnta*,  

but announcing first the scheme adopted. e.g. Max-MularaH. And in all such cases,  

it may be desirable to put the original name with the original spelling within brackets *  
*

*when it occurs for the first time*.

  

The use of the expression "*vibhaktis*" is not wrong at all. Of course, we have a ready

and common counterpart viz. "case termination" for *vibhakti*, but the expressions are not necessarily  

coterminous. *Vibhakti* is a wider term. We cannot always get exact equivalences  

of technical terms of one language in another. And in such cases, it is best to  

use the technical term of the other language as such.

  

Personally, I adopt a method of differentiating the base of one language

from the suffix of another by adding a hyphen in between. Thus, I would

rather say *vibhakti*-s, than just *vibhaktis*.

  

I suppose I have answered your queries.

Regards
