Dear Sri Ramesh Krishnamurthy,  

  

If you are referring to the base, use अनुष्टुभ्.

If the word is an inflected form of that base (i.e. the form in some *vibhakti*),  

you will not be using "अनुष्टुभ् " (which is to say, you would be using that *vibhaktyanta*-form).

This is wrt Sanskrit script.

  

If English, if you are not referring to the inflected form,

then use *anuShTu**bh*** only.

  

(Incidentally, there are several errors in the Sanskrit text you have copied.

Check with the original carefully).
