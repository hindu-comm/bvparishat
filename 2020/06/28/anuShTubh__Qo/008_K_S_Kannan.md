In non-Indian languages, it is a standard convention regularly followed, to cite Sanskrit words  

in their *prAtipadika*-form, not the *prathamaikavacana* (Nominative Singular) form.

  

This is why it is proper, while speaking or writing in those languages,  

to speak of *upaniSha**d** (*the base)*,* (and not *upaniSha**t***, the Nominative Singular form).

On exactly the same grounds, *anuShTu**bh*** becomes proper usage (not *anuShTu**p***);

*vA**c*** (not *vA**k***).  

  

The situation in the context of communicating in Indian languages is different:

we are more accustomed to *upaniSha**t, ** anuShTu**p**,* and *vA**k.***

***

*So the norm is* :

One may use the *prathamAnta* form in Indian languages,

but one must use the *prAtipadika* form in non-Indian languages.
