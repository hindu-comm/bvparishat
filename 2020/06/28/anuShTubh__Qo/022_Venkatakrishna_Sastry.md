Namaste PVS Kumar



You have raised a series of questions. My answers ( or I should be more cautious and say my personal thoughts and understanding) is placed below.

The problem is real and relevant. So are the 'state of art solutions' that are available and delivering a ' limited purpose benefit'. 



I lead to the conclusion of action invite: How many in in -house team are willing to support and be team members to explore the issues rasied by you here and pointers made in my response ?

for ' passion and love of Samskuth' ? And I believe the the rest to be happy and 'plan to remain consumer of freebies' , as service -professionals ? Or just be ' elders to bless and be critical audience- commenting- auditors of this enterprise' ?



Concluding observation: In the current period, there are twenty two known and live models of ROMANIZATION= SCRIPTING DEVANGARI LETTER UNITS in ROMAN SCRIPT in social and technology practice. These have been developed over last three hundred years and let loose globally and in technology. For which one we need the solution? Why?





-----------------



**PVS Kumar-01** : I am curious to know if there are any such other **norms for mixing Sanskrit words** with Indian and foreign languages; 



^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry -01**: Yes. There are guidelines. This is on SCRIPTING practice. The debate is called ' lipi-shaastra'. It is more than finding the historic evolution of orthography, fonts display, glyphs, how long should the top -line be in devanagari scripting ? et al. ( As I am typing this mail, you can notice : I am mixing the romanization conventions- in representing Devangari words ! Call it habit, convneience, laziness, or readers understand wha tis being written.
Unless attention is drawn to this, specifically, we overlook. and Prof. Kannan has a good eye for this) .



The discipline needs deep research, contemplation from Paninian perspective for scripting design evolution at India for three millennium. What is available as ' script evolution, decoding of an inscription' is one line to understand ' what is scribed'. It does not answer the question' how the script for writing was designed'.



Lipi-shaastra discipline answers how to mix of 'Paninian Samskruth words and ' Words \< of Indian = Prakruth, apbhramsha> and foreign- defunct- disrupted - languages= mlecchita>.

**PVS Kumar-02** : I am curious to know if there are any such other norms for mixing Sanskrit words with Indian and foreign languages; **mixing Indian/foreign language words with Sanskrit especially** with verbs and Names (proper nouns). 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry -02**: Yes. There are guidelines. This is on SCRIPTING of LANGUAGE WORDS. - Bhashaa- lipi-paddhati ( Generally called as **Rosetta stone model**.).

The expression ' Deva-Bhashaa' for Samskrutham needs a deeper understanding beyond ' language of( tribal)
gods' ?!



What is Rosetta stone model ? - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone> The Rosetta Stone is a granodiorite stele discovered in 1799 which is inscribed with three versions of a decree issued in Memphis, Egypt in 196 BC during the Ptolemaic dynasty on behalf of King Ptolemy V Epiphanes. The top and middle texts are in Ancient Egyptian using hieroglyphic and Demotic scripts respectively, while the bottom is in Ancient Greek. The decree has only minor differences among the three versions, so the Rosetta Stone became key to deciphering Egyptian hieroglyphs, thereby opening a window into ancient Egyptian history. Three other fragmentary copies of the same decree were discovered later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including three slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees: the Decree of Alexandria in 243 BC, the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of Ptolemy IV, c. 218 BC. The Rosetta Stone is no longer unique, but it was the essential key to the modern understanding of ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term Rosetta Stone is now used to refer to the essential clue to a new field of knowledge. 

The decree concludes with the instruction that a copy was to be placed in every temple, inscribed in the "language of the gods" (Egyptian hieroglyphs), the "language of documents" (Demotic), and the "language of the Greeks" as used by the Ptolemaic government. Securing the favour of the priesthood was essential for the Ptolemaic kings to retain effective rule over the populace. The[High Priests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Priest_of_Ptah "High Priest of Ptah")of[Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt "Memphis, Egypt")—where the king was crowned—were particularly important, as they were the highest religious authorities of the time and had influence throughout the kingdom





--------------------------------------------

**PVS Kumar-03** : . Please guide me to any specific rules/norms well accepted/published **about how to strip-off vibhaktis of other Indian languages** 

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry -03**: The grammar of each langauge of india provides the bi-directional rules to add and strip off vibhaktis.

The exercise is only a smaller part of the big exercise called ' Vakya-Artha Nirnaya'. Vak-artha nirnaya is a part of 'Vak-yoga' Paddhati, aka Yoga-Samskrutham.

How -to part is each langauge specific.



--------------------------------------------

**PVS Kumar-04** : Please guide me to any specific rules/norms well accepted/published about how to strip-off vibhaktis of other Indian languages **and how to add Sanskrit vibhaktis, etc**.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry -04**: The grammar of Samskruth langauge by Panini
provides the bidirectional rules to add and strip off Samskruth vibhaktis.

The exercise is only a smaller part of the big exercise called ' Pada-Artha Nirvachana' .

 This allied discipline of Vyakarana, is called ' NIRUKTA. This is NOT the same as ' LEXICON ( kosha) model .




Indian system is to study Vyakarana- Nirukta together to understand 'Vakya- Kavya'.

Colonial system is to study ' grammar- lexiocn' together to understand 'scripted text - discourse ' in the frame work of 'social usage and langauge- literature'. 



--------------------------------------------

**PVS Kumar-05** : Similarly **how to transport Sanskrit words to English** and other foreign languages (The word I have used above "Vibhaktis" - **though technically may not be correct but, we tend to use.)** Are there are any guidelines for these?



^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry -05**: This is a cross lingual transportation of 'Idea' and re-creation of expression. One needs Bhashaa Shastra jnana + Pratibhaa to do this.



People tend to use ' grammar' flexibly'. It is not the job of gramamrian to go and fix each abuse of langauge or mis-translation of source text.



Best examples: Translation of Vedas, Ramayana, Mahabharata which have been debated on this very forum with great fervor and defended as to what is right in our opinion' , without need to calrify 'why it is right' ? (or it has to be right)? !



--------------------------------------------

**PVS Kumar-06** : Similarly **how to transport Sanskrit words** to English and **other foreign languages** (The word I have used above "Vibhaktis" - though technically may not be correct but, we tend to use.) Are there are any guidelines for these?



^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**BVK Sastry -06**: Response same as at point 5 above.



--------------------------------------------

** **

**BVK Sastry Concluding **: Single Language domain answers can be given for these issues. The Samskruth Langauge convention clearly says :



 'Pratipadika' can not be used in any sentence without the ' Pratyaya' ( sup or ting) wrap over it.

 User is free to give a predefined samjnaa' with clarity on the tags of anta- linga…..' needed for appropriate 'pratyaya addition'.

Pratyaya and Prakriya come from grammar. Vivakshaa comes from user. Samarthya is contextual. Output must comply to ' Grammar guidance'. 



 *In scripting*,

If one is opting for 'Brahmi Devanagari Scripting', The script must truly represent the spoken expression.

(Use of svara marker/ diacritic is users preference and expectation of precision'.)

 There are sounds which are used in other (indian as well as foreign langauges) which do not map totally to the known 'Devangari character set'. There is an approximation.

 The english word' Xavier' can not be devanagari scripted to give the sound of english word .

 Try another word 'Apple-Macintosh'.

 Write in devanagari and ask some on else to read it to see whether the english speaker- user
get back the total phonetic vlaue'.



I have addressed some of these fundamental issues in my publication 'Sanskrit-Computers' and pathways to address the goal of ' Panini Machine'. ( Look for the Book on amazon/ kindle). These are parts of my teaching course on 'How to study -use Samskruth for Computers'.
