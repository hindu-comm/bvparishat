Pranam to all scholars

  

This group has already discussed the definitionof अनुष्टुभ्, and I participated in that discussion as well. Now, I just realized that the first shloka from सप्तशती also does not fit into the general definition of अनुष्टुभ्.

  
सावर्णिः सूर्यतनयोः यो मनुः कथ्यतेऽष्टमः ।

निशामय तदुत्पत्तिं विस्ताराद्गदतो मम ॥  
  
In the first quarter, both sixth and seventh syllables are short; as per the general definition, they both should be long.

  

Best regards,  
  
Prakash
