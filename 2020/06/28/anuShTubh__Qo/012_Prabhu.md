shri Prakash Pandey mahodaya,

  

I am copy-pasting shri Roland Steiner mahodaya’s response, from an earlier discussion on this:

“This is a completely regular Anuṣṭubh, but not in the "normal form" (*pathyā*), but in a form called*vipulā*("extension"). More precisely it is a*na-vipulā*, in which the syllables 5-7 are all short (=*na-gaṇa*), whereas the 4th syllable then has to be long.”

Prabhu
