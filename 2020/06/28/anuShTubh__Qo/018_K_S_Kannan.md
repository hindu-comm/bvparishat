What little I know I will place here.

Others can improve upon/rectify mine.

  

When you use a Sanskrit word **in an Indian language**, it is mostly as a *tatsama*.

*Tatsama*-s mostly carry the same value (but not always;

there are cases of *faux ami* where we have to be careful, esp. reg. the sense).

The *tatsama* word will have become a regular part of the Indian language in question,

and is declined/conjugated like a regular vocable in that language.

The patterns and paradigms required for this can be learnt  

from a grammar book of that language.

  

Now, when we use a Sanskrit word **in a non-Indian language**,

the first thing to do is to italicise it. For example, the word *tatsama*  

was used in the above paragraph thrice, and every time it is italicised.

This is because, any word from a foreign language is shown in italics in general.

That is why the expression "faux ami" was shown in italics in the above paragraph.

  

Further, whenever you are drawing attention to a word as such

(which is to say not to its sense), then the word is shown in italics,

or is put in inverted commas - as was done for *faux ami* in the last line of the last para.

  

The Roman script makes easy/standard provision for this italicisation,

whereas Indian scripts do not have this facility - which is to say, by way of  

standardised representation. Hence we do not see italicised material

put to such use in a standard fashion in Indian scripts.

  

I suppose this should help.
