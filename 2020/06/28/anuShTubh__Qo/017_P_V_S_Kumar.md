Dear Prof. Kannan ji,

  

I am curious to know if there are any such other norms for mixing Sanskrit words with Indian and foreign languages; mixing Indian/foreign language words with Sanskrit especially with verbs and Names (proper nouns). e.g. How to write a foreigner's name in Sanskrit. Please guide me to any specific rules/norms well accepted/published about how to strip-off vibhaktis of other Indian languages and how to add Sanskrit vibhaktis, etc.Similarly how to transport Sanskrit words to English and other foreign languages (The word I have used above "Vibhaktis" - though technically may not be correct but, we tend to use.) Are there are any guidelines for these?

  

  

Regards

P V S Kumar
