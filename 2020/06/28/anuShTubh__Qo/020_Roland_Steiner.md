\> It appears that the restrictions on shloka were less strict in the epics  
\> than in the classical period. For example, I realized that even सर्वत्र लघु  
\> पञ्चमं is not universal, as I was just reading this verse from the Gita  
\> (18.13):  
\>  
\> पञ्चैतानि महाबाहो कारणानि निबोध मे।  
\> सांख्ये कृतान्ते प्रोक्तानि सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम्।।  
  

The second line is a regular *ma-vipulā*, which is also quite common in *kāvya*, although the authors of metrics, beginning with Piṅgala, do not teach a *ma-vipulā*, but instead a *ta-vipulā* (Piṅgala 5.19: *bhrau ntau ca*), which practically does not appear in the literature. The same as for the *ma-vipulā* also applies to the *bha-vipulā* and the *ra-vipulā* (that is to all regular *vipulās* except the *na-vipulā*), which also have a long fifth syllable.  
  
Best regards,
