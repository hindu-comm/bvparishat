Simple example cited by you वाक्पति does not make the*sandhi*optional in Samasa.

  

**The transformation of ' *sandhi* ' seems to be optional for me in the context of the rule 3750: illustration placed  
**

**below. (Though rule speaks about the samasa with ' pati' shabda for a svara issue, the point to note is \< unchanged ka>**  

  

It it seems that you also accept समास in the example, but wanted to point out that unchanged ka.



BUT I wonder about the remark assumingthat it would be the same letter in all 'sandhi's if sandhi is done. I need not remind you the *sandhi* rule makes the change according to the letters preceding and and following. In this case, वाच्+पति is the form of the bare प्रातिपदिकs after loosing the case-ending of thd compounded words वाचाम् पतिः the preceding letter which च् in the first word that undergoes the changes due to *sandhi* rules applicable. In this case, in चोः कुः makes the chage from च् to क् first. Then it is changed to ग् in *sandhi*according to झलां जश् झशि in वाग्योग due to the next letter. In वाच्+पति it is changed into क् due to the operation of the rule खरि च. Hence the exmple does not point out to the absence of*sandhi* in समास as you have suggested. And the same letter च् becomes changed to ङ् befoe any अनुनासिक letter. As in वाङ् मे मनसि श्रितः। मनो मे वाचि. orवाक् च मनश्च वाङ्मनसे in द्वन्द्व compound. So it is due to*sandhi*rules it is changed to क् and not because of*sandhi* is optional.

  

Finally it should be वाच्+योग \> वाग्योग according to*sandhi*rules.

  

Sorry. I interference in between. But I could not tolerate such a remark.
