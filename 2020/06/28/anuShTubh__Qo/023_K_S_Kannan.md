As this is a scholarly platform, Prof. BVKSastry would do well to do some proof-reading of his own very many contributions to BVP. Else, it gives a bad impression - an impression of frivolousness on the part of the writer. It may not also be good to bring everything finally to just "Vak-yoga". (Btw, at least call it vAg-yoga, as sandhi is after all compulsory in samAsa).
