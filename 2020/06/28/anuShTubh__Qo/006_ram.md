It may not be quite appropriate to say -- \`\`the first sloka from सप्तशती also does not fit into the general definition of अनुष्टुभ्"

अनुष्टुप् -- is the generic name of 8-syllabled meter (वर्णवृत्त). There are 256 variations that are possible. What Sri Pandey perhaps means is -- it does not fit the definition of श्लोक, which is a variety of अनुष्टुप् ।  

Best regards,

-ram.
