Namaste Prof. KSK



1. Thanks for going through the mail response and making three speciifc observations, which are off tangent to the main issue and
responses made !



 1a: \< communicating the impressions> ::\< Else, it gives a bad impression - an impression of frivolousness on the part of the writer>



 1b: \<opinion making \> on \< my connecting Samskrutham deliberations to \<vAk-Yoga> ?? :: \< It may not also be good to bring everything finally to just "Vak-yoga". >



 1c: suggestion on how to treat the term \< vAk-yoga> : \< (Btw, at least call it vAg-yoga, as sandhi is after all compulsory in samAsa). \> 



 Thanks for taking note of the fact that sanskrit related discussions find a root-solution in the keyconcept \<vAg-yoga> as you desire to see it on the mail ! 



Like PVS Kumar, you have also raised a series of questions , to
sidetrack the main issue ! .



We would not be engaged on this friendly mail exchange, if you had noticed two specific observations I made in the post , one on \< Convention of Romanization> and other on \< **norms for mixing Sanskrit words** with Indian and foreign languages\> . The observation was precisely to draw the keen eye needed in exploring the issues raised by PVS Kumar. I left some of those spelling errors in the post, for a reason ! ( I am not trying to defend my self.) And as expected, you caught them . Good. But you did not go to the root of the problem!



I am placing a question at the end of this post on this point and seek your wise advise.

2. On connecting the Samskrutham related discussions to \<vAk-yoga> ,
what makes you think : \< It may not also be good to bring everything \> Where else do you want it to be connected ? Any good suggestions which over run the wisdom provided by Patanjali and Bhartruhari ?

3. On the compulsoriness of 'sandhi' in 'samAsa' … the term , \<vAk-yoga> is a vedic word. The transformation of ' sandhi '
seems to be optional for me in the context of the rule 3750: illustration placed below. (Though rule speaks about the samasa with ' pati' shabda for a svara issue, the point to note is \< unchanged ka \>.

If the argument is to go by \<samsa> itslef, the reference below from Monier Williams may be worth deliberating: The base should have been \< वाच्\> and not \< वाक्\>.

There is lot more to contemplate when a 'Chandas' term is being brought under the construction of \<bhashaa- vyakarana- niyama>. \[ should I have used bhAzaa ?? \>

I respect your views and take your observations in good spirit. If you have anything speciifc to contribute on the points made, please add.



Ending with a question: My name and your name has two 'K's from roman alphabet set, at the beginning and middle. What would be the difference in lower case- upper case for value of pronunciation and scripting ?

क-- ख ::: k - K -- Krishna, Kannan ? -- खृष्ण - खण्णन् or कृष्ण - कण्णान् ??



Look for your wisdom and scripting practice guidance

Regards



BVK Sastry
