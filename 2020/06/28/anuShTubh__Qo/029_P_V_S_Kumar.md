Dear Prof. Kannan ji,

  

Your responses are definitely helpful for me. But actually what I am looking for is much wider, though I did not express it explicitly in my question. What I am looking for is a 'Style Guide' (somewhat in the lines of '

### The Chicago Manual of Style')

for writing and editing Sanskrit or Sanskrit based text, meeting the needs of current day requirements. If you come across any such work, how small or big it may be, please let me know.

  

Regards

  

P.V.S. Kumar
