There was a discussion a while back on rAmA vs rAmI where Acharya Korada Subramanian-ji pointed out that rAmasya patnI rAmI as perpANini 4.1.48 puMyogAd-AkhyAyAm. Similarly padmanetrasya patnI padmanetrI I would think. If it were referring to a woman with lotus like eyes it would be wrong I suppose. Perhaps the grammarians can weigh in here.
