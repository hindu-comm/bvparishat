Dear Prof. Misra,

  

\> I might sound off-track in this logic, But the simplistic assumptions in the standard treatment

are not convincing. I will write more with evidence in course of time.

  

----- You know that you are already off-track and need to collect evidences for your off-track theorization.

  

Enormous amount of evidences are already produced for the advanced southern culture(s ) of ancient times.

  

On another thread, there was just the opposite side of the argument that things went from the south to the north.

  

There is no point in wasting our time on this evolutionist 'primitive' --> hunter-gatherer --> pastoral ---> agricultural kind of discussion.

  

This thread is not focused on that.

  

We are looking at origins of Natya from Vedic.

  

You wanted to add cultures independent of Vedic to it. Point well taken.

  

Only your insistence on the east has been modified with 'from all parts of the Indic sub-continent.'

  

Let us not get into the unprovable and irrelevant, evolutionist, misleading, digressive domainsof 'south or east, which is first?' - All these are baalis'a discussions.
