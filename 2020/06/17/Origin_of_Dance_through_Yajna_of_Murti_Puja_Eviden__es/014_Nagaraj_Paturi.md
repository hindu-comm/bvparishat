Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam responded to Prof. Bharat Gupta's invitation saying,

  

Please do take into consideration and respond publicly to Natalia's wider thesis thatthe Nāṭya-Śāstra, from which theHindu worship of anthropomorphic images would have been derived, would have itself been fundamentally influenced by Dravidian religious practices (as opposed to the Vedic yajña).

  

I have done my part through multiple posts to our Abhinavagupta forum that were later summarized and incorporated in the above article (cited above) submitted to IGNA for eventual publication (but when?).

  

Best wishes,

  

Sunthar
