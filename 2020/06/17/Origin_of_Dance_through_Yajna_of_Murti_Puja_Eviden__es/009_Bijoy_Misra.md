Prof Paturi,

I would use the phrase "southern settlements". That would be late. The eastern settlement

has to do with the archeological evidence of domesticated agriculture and farming. The  

agriculture makes the ground as the food-bearing object and gradually develops theory

of production connected to individual actions (karma). The theory of an unchanging universe  

and theory of life through recycling becomes an offshoot of strong localized concentration  

on agriculture in a forest setting. It appears that these "eastern" agricultural settlers have  

hardly moved since their settlement and live in individually closed and separated societies  

similar to what we see in the Americas.  

The southern settlement appears to come later. The development there looks more

primitive as we may reconstruct from Valmiki. I have not fully thought through to help

visualize the development (I am trying to learn Tamil). Individual responsibility as part of

cosmology develops, but centers on personal conduct (shiva) rather than the treatment  

of nature (bhUmi).

I might sound off-track in this logic, But the simplistic assumptions in the standard treatment

are not convincing. I will write more with evidence in course of time.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
