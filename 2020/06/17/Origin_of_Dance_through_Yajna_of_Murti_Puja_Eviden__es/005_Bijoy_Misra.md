Dear Prof Paturi,

As I had mentioned before, I am gradually inclined to believe that a whole indigenous culture and living system

existed in the eastern part of the country independent of the Vedic culture. People there were engaged in  

agriculture and had their fascination with objects like hills, rivers, trees or snakes. Possibly the concept of Earth  

(ground) itself as a holy object emerged in the tradition. Melodic expression, drums and folk singing could follow.  

Astronomical events were greeted by awe, wonder and drums. Evidence of all this is in the lifestyle of whatever  

remnants we have in the hills of Jharkhand,m Chhatishgarh and Odisha.
It is easy to see how puja "worship"  

as a concept could develop culturally in such a society. These areas remain non-vedic even now. Story-telling  

and cultural teaching through mime, facials and masks are common-place. So, I would think theater in India  

was much older than the vedic period. Public gatherings were theatrical. It was more social than religious.

Theater was eventually adopted by the priests through whatever evidence we may construct from the Vedic  

texts. The development of a murti or a vigraha could be an amalgamation of the old puja ritual and the vedic  

divinities. The current mudra ritual in a puja is possibly connected to the old gestural tradition.  

We need to increase field studies before these "aborigine" communities are wiped out for mining and otherwise.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
