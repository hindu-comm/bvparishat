Prof Paturi,

The relevance of Natya is if it comes from folk-theater or

vedic shrauta rituals. I would remain open in my thinking

till I fully explore the Tamil literature. I am studying Sangam  

period now. Development of belief systems is a little more  

different than language, as I estimate.  

You could be right in your assertions. Let us not bother

further now till I write up more in a paper.  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
