Dear Vidwaan Jan,

  

I am wondering during the time of Vedic era there used to be so many rishis and Maharishis who used to "time travel back in the past". Since they used to be Trikaldarshi, they used to confirm what is right or wrong based on their divya drishti. Or lets say they used to say in which part of the earth contains what based on the BhuGarbh vidya or whatstheir in the Brahmand based on Antariksh vidya. Or they used to make their body appear or disappear wherever they want. I am wondering which mahatma or expert possesses those divine Vidya today.

  

Just curious!!

  

Kind regards,

Manish
