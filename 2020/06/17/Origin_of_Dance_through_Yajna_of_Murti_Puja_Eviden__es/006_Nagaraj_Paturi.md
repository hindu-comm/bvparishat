Dear Dr Irene Galstian,

  

I was just showing one model of theorizing the origins of Natya.

  

Older than this is the one by Dr Sunthar Visuvalingam (the reviewer here) himself.  

  

His PhD was on Mricchakatikam and in that, he proposed a Yajna model for Natya and placed Sanskrit Drama into that model showing as an example.  

  

That is the reason he is in agreement to some extent and in debate to a large extent with Dr Natalia Lidova.  

  

"Abhinavagupta's Conception of Humor: Its Resonances in Sanskrit Drama, Poetry, Hindu Mythology & Spiritual Praxis"
