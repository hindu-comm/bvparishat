Thank you, Professor Paturi.

  

What a strange claim... So a whole class of human beings, the "lower rank" Brahmin priests, who, as Lidova claims, were excluded from śrauta ceremonies by the social situation of the time, started performing pūjās instead, which developed into dance and drama. These priests knew the Vedic ritual, its movements and its connotations, but were socially excluded from performing them for some reason. How can it be said that there's no connection with Vedic ritual when these people themselves are the connection? Look also at some of the complex Vedic rituals: they were already compelling dramatic productions that continued for days.

  

Please help/correct if I misunderstood. I also wonder how the genesis of complex and expressive facial expressions, poses, gestures, and movements might have taken place.

  

Thank you,  

Irene
