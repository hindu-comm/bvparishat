I missed to paste the following text from the announcement:

  

It is taken for granted that Murti Puja has nothing to do with Vedic Yajna. The whole enterprise of Arya Samaj/ Brahmos and Christianity inspired Hindu reformers was based on this presumption.

  

The actual growth of the murti has never been traced. We have followed a dubious path of arguing the growth of the hHindu temple from vedic alter.

  

NS chapter 4, delineates the transition from a Devata's Avaahan and his stavan or praise through Vaak puja or mantra ucchaaran in Yajna to representation of a Devataa or Devi as a dancing figure/body/pinda/Rupa.

  

Please join to the seminar on this on 22 6 20 at 11am-1230pm.
