Dear Prof. Misra,

  

A whole indigenous culture and living system existing independent of the Vedic culture and that contributing to the development of Indian culture along with Vedic Culture is not a new idea. The idea of your inclination is distinct only in limiting it to the east.  

  

The older outdated model is that of Aryan-Dravidian for this. What you call 'indigenous' , 'independent of Vecic culture' was all dumped into one label called 'Dravidian'  

  

What Veda mantras themselves acknowledge is multiple indigenous cultures outside /independent of the Vedic fold existing in the Indic subcontinent.  

  

'Dravidian' takes it and limits it most of the times to the south.  

  

The place of early Veda mantras is located by historians of that corpus in the north-west in the north-west of Indic landscape. The indigenous cultures outside /independent of the Vedic fold acknowledge in the mantras must then be in the mantras must then be in that part.  

  

You believe indigenous cultures outside /independent of the Vedic fold to be in the east.

  

The truth must be a combination of all these and more.  

  

Iindigenous cultures outside /independent of the Vedic fold from all parts of the Indic subcontinent must have got joined the Vedic Culture which is the only pan-Indian contributor, unity and uniformity giver and standardizer in the emergence of this Puranic/ Agamic/ 'classical' /'Hindu' culture.  

  

Natya of Natya Shastra too must be part of such a cultural development. So contribution of indigenous cultures outside /independent of the Vedic foldto the emergence of Natya of Natya Shastra need not be ruled out.
