Just now noticed a typo in my translation and corrected it:

  

“असिद्धं कालिदासत्वं” भाषते न्यायवित्तम: ।

कथमेनां निराकुर्मो लोभयन्तीं शकुन्तलाम् ।।

  

The logician says that there is no proof that someone named Kalidasa actually existed. However, how can we set aside the attractive Shakuntala?
