That's true, Professor Wakankar. In retrospect, Rajwade's translation may have been the one I should've studied to begin with, but Sarup was the only available option during the lockdown. You see, I'm trying to salvage an ailing project, and I've only got a few days to finish it. Because of this, I'm guessing that this round will have to play out without Rajwade, but I'll make sure to find his translation, especially now that you've recommended it.
