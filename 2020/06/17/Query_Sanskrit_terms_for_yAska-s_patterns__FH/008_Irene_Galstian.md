Thank you, Professor Paturi. The link is to Sarup, the only currently available English translation, which has pros and cons.

My query is about another thing. Many word-formation patterns in Nirukta are phonological effects. In fact, anyone who's had a toddler in the house for any length of time, had access to a fairly well-equipped Nirukta lab. What I'd like to know is, did later Nairuktas just use Yāska's descriptions, or where there terms defined? If terms were defined, then when and by whom? This way I can locate the text(s) in question and study them.
