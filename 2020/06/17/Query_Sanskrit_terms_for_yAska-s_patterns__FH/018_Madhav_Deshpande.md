Here are my explanations of these examples:

  

वर्णागमः in हंसः - This assumes that the word हंस is derived from the root हस् हसति. In that case, the अनुस्वार is a वर्णागम "an added sound."

  

वर्णविपर्ययः in सिंहः - This assumes that the word सिंह is derived from the root हिंस् हिनस्ति. In that case, there is metathesis: "changing the order of sounds.".

  

वर्णविकृतिः in गूढोsत्मा - In this example, the normal sandhi of गूढ: आत्मा can only be गूढ आत्मा. Hence, in the outcome गूढोऽत्मा, there is an unexpected change of sounds.

  

वर्णनाशः in पृषोदरम्‌ - In this example, the word पृषोदर is derived from पृषत्+उदर. What happened to the sound "त्"? It just disappeared. This is described by the term वर्णनाश.
