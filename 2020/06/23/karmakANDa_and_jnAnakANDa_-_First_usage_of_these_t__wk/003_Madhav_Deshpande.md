Dear Subrahmanian Ji,

  

  It is my impression that I have come across such a clear division of ज्ञानकाण्ड and कर्मकाण्ड for the first time only in the Bhāṣyas of Śaṅkarācārya. The previous Bhāṣyas that he rejects seem to have upheld the view of ज्ञानकर्मसमुच्चय, and hence they are unlikely to have upheld such a clear division. The Mīmāṃsāsūtras of Jaimini and Brahmasūtras of Bādarāyaṇa seem to have different views on the ultimate goal of the Veda, and one can read a distinction likeज्ञानकाण्ड and कर्मकाण्ड in their views, but this is not entirely certain. To my knowledge, the Mīmāṃsā view of the Upaniṣads is more like अर्थवाद, and clearly this would not qualify them as ज्ञानकाण्ड in the strict Mīmāṃsā view. A categorical distinction betweenज्ञानकाण्ड and कर्मकाण्ड is an outcome of the emergence of the Advaita Vedānta. This is just my impression.
