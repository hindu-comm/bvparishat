Footnote in Gita Press edition is as follows:

  

It has already been pointed out in a footnote below the translation of II. liv.28 on p.441 of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa Number III that by trebling the figure mentioned in the text according to the rules governing the compound Ekadēśa Dvandva or according to what is known as the Kapinjallādhikaraṇa Nyāya in the Pūrva-Mīmāmsā Philosophy the learned author of the commentary known by the name of "Rāmāyaṇa śirōmaṇi" takes the figure of two and half Yojanas or ten Kosas to mean thirty Kosas or sixty miles and making allowance for the difference in the standards of measurement obtaining in those days the distance of Chitrakūṭa from Prayāga works out to be the same as it is now calculated, to be, viz., eighty miles.

  

Footnote by Prof. Sheldon Pollock is as follows:

  

Note 10 (p. 483): "'two and a half'*ardhatṛtīyeṣu*: Numerical compounds with*ardha-*are ambiguous. Here, as often when an ordinal is used, half of the*uttarapada*is added to the next lower number ('the third being a half,' cf. German*drittehalb*). In 48.25 Bharadvāja says Citrakūṭa is ten*krośas*away from Prayāga; at the usual computation of four*krośas*per*yojana*, two and a half would indeed be correct (cf. \[K.S.\] Varadacharya 1964-1965, \[*Śrīmadvālmīkirāmāyaṇam with Amṛtakataka of Mādhavayogī: Ayodhyākāṇḍa*, Mysore, vol. 2, p. 270n)."
