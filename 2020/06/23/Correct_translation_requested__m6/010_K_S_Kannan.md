That's right.

  

I only said it as an *aside*,

showing a different possibility of the mere literal sense,

(hence indicated within brackets).



The whole context naturally becomes important

when rendering a passage. Which is why

I first enquired about the context, which was not answered.

  

I did not have the time/patience to look for/into the original,

though it could be surmised as the *Ramayana*.

But I did later verify the original.
