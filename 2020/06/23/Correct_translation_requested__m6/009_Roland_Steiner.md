Since *ramyanirdarakānanaḥ* is an attribute of *citrakūṭaḥ* here, *nirdara* does not mean "without caverns", if only for reasons that lie in the matter at hand. See only Rāma's description of Mount Citrakūṭa (*Rāmāyaṇa*, crit. ed.: 2.88.14):  
  
guhāsamīraṇo gandhān nānāpuṣpabhavān vahan  
ghrāṇatarpaṇam abhyetya kaṃ naraṃ na praharṣayet  
  
See also Pollock's note 2.79.19-20 (p. 471): "\[...\]*.* *Nirdara* is a rare word, but one Vālmīki is fond of. Comparing its use in 3.63.5, 4.42.17 (and 4.13.5, where it must be read in place of the crit. ed.'s *nirjhara*-), we find that Cm's \[= the commentary *Tattvadīpikā* of Maheśvaratīrtha\] explanation in 3.63.5 is correct: 'paths through openings in rocks.'"  
  
The Gita press edition (kindly provided by Prof. Paturi) reads °*nirjhara*°, but translates °*nirdara*°: "abounding in lovely caves and groves."
