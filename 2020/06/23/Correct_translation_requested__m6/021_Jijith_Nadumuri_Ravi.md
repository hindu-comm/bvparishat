Dear Scholars

  

Your help needed to understand these verses more closely

  

परिक्षिप्ता समुद्रेण लङ्केयं शतयोजना

This is in Valmiki Ramayana Aranya Kanda, Sarga 53, 19th Verse of CE.

Both the Valmiki Ramayana Dot Net by Hanumanta Rao and IITK is giving the translation that Lanka is of 100 Yojana width. Parikshiptaalso gives the meaning of surrounded by (ocean). Yet I am asking to know if there is any remote possibility of this verse being translated to mean that Lanka is 100 Yojana away in the sea?

  

I am asking, because I had a discussion with a researcher who considers that many verses like these are not mentioning the size of Lanka but instead mentioning the distance towards it.

  

Here is another similar verse:-

  

द्वीपस् तस्यापरे पारे शतयोजनम् आयतः  

Valmiki Ramayana Kishkindha Kanda, Sarga 40, 24th Verse of CE. In VRM.Net (Hanumanta Rao) and IITK this verse will be found in 41st Sarga.

Ayata gives the meaning:- stretch, length etc. Here too, most translations take this island as having 100 Yojana in size rather than 100 Yojana away in the sea. Hanumanta Rao identifiesthis as Lanka itself. But I want to know if it can even remotely be translated as distance in sea towards the island?  

  

Besides, in the verse below which I discussed earlier, each of us unanimously took 2.5 Yojana as the distance towards Chitrakuta but he considers it as the height of Chitrakuta. Do such a possibility exist?

भरतार्धतृतीयेषु योजनेष्व् अजने वने  
चित्रकूटो गिरिस् तत्र रम्यनिर्दरकाननः  

  

Does this verse have an attested variation as **yojane vijane vane** instead of **yojaneshv-ajane vane**?

  

Many Thanks and Regards

Jijith
