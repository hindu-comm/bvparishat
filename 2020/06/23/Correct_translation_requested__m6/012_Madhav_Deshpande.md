The term अर्धतृतीय in this verse is the source of Marathi अडीच for two and a half. A similar term is द्व्यर्ध elsewhere which is the source of Marathi दीड for one and a half,which is similar to Pali दियड्ढ. A similar expression is common in Pali suttas: Lord Buddha was traveling with अड्ढतेळसेहि भिक्खुसतेहि "with twelve and a half" hundreds of monks. This would correspond to अर्धत्रयोदश in Buddhist Sanskrit texts.
