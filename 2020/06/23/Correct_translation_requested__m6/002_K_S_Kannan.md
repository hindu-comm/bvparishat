An attempt, yet - though context will be a better help.

  

"Oh Bharata, \[advance\] three and a half *yojana*-s \[from here\] in the uninhabited forest:

\[you will encounter\] the CitrakUTa mountain with its charming forests with little to fear there."

  

Does this help?

Others may improve on this.
