\> भरतार्धतृतीयेषु योजनेष्व् अजने वने  
\> चित्रकूटो गिरिस् तत्र रम्यनिर्दरकाननः  
  

It is *Rāmāyaṇa* 2.86.10 (crit. ed.):  
  
"Bharata, at a distance of two and a half leagues through the lonely forest is Mount Citrakūṭa, a place of lovely caverns and woodlands." (transl. Sheldon I. Pollock, *The Rāmāyaṇa of Vālmīki*, vol. 2: *Ayodhyākāṇḍa*, First Indian Edition: Delhi 2007, p. 264 ).  
  
Note 10 (p. 483): "'two and a half' *ardhatṛtīyeṣu*: Numerical compounds with *ardha-* are ambiguous. Here, as often when an ordinal is used, half of the *uttarapada* is added to the next lower number ('the third being a half,' cf. German *drittehalb*). In 48.25 Bharadvāja says Citrakūṭa is ten *krośas* away from Prayāga; at the usual computation of four *krośas* per *yojana*, two and a half would indeed be correct (cf. \[K.S.\] Varadacharya 1964-1965, \[*Śrīmadvālmīkirāmāyaṇam with Amṛtakataka of Mādhavayogī: Ayodhyākāṇḍa*, Mysore, vol. 2, p. 270n)."  
  
Best,
