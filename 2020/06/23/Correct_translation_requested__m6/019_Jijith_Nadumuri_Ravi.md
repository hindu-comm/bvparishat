Many thanks to all of you, Kannan ji, Roland ji, Paturi ji, Ramakrishnan ji and Karoda ji

  

I wanted to know the meaning of this particular verse in detail, since it is explaining the distance between two well known places defined in Yojana, whose distance defined in Krosha is already stated in another verse, like Roland ji has pointed out.

  

This is one among the many verses thatI lean on, to understand the expression of distances in Valmiki Ramayana.

  

Regards

Jijith
