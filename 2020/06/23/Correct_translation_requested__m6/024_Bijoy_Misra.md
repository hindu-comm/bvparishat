आयतः is past participle.  

I would interpret as " a hundred yojana traveled island" like "a mile long scaled mountain-peak" , there is a destination, the action is to reach.  

शतयोजन as a phrase is used in the context of "difficult to achieve" in those chapters in general.  

योजन is a length measure. He has other words for size like दीर्घ, प्राकार, वर्ग.
