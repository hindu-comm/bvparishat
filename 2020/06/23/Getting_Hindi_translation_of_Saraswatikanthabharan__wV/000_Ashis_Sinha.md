Kindly help me by giving a link from which I can download Hindi translation of 1st & 2nd Parichhedas of Saraswatikanthabharana of Bhojadeva. I did not find it in [archive.org](http://archive.org).

But I have already got Hindi translationof this book from Chapter 3 to 5 edited by Kameswarnath Misra and published by Chakhamva Orientalia.

  

              With regards,

                                   
                 Ms. S. Sinha.
