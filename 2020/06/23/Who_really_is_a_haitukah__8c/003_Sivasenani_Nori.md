Namaste. I will try to answer this shortly. Mimasakas rejectadrishtaphala when there is a drishtaphala. This doctrine looks reasonable on thesurface but in application, it gives rise to the feeling that Mimamsakas have no use for Sastra, and especially Isvara. Let me give an example. There is a nishedha called बर्हिषि रजतं न देयम् (silver ought not to be offered as a dakshina in a Yajna). Now, if we seek an explanation, for the Mimamsaks there is a ready explanation: if the yajamaanaparts with silver, he will cry due to depletion of his wealth; so, do not offer silver. The problem with this argument is that other daanas - like hiraNya-daana are prescribed. Since no drishta-phala is available there, apurva is invoked.

  

"Then, why don't we invoke apurva for the prohibition on donating silver?"

"Not needed, so we do not."

"Is it not inconsistent."

"No, it is in accordance with the principle that there is no need for adrishta-phala when drishta-phala is available. One who knows Sastra and the bala and abala of different principles, see no inconsistency."

  

Similarly with respect to Isvara, when apurva can explain everything, there seems to be no active role assigned to Isvara and so Mimamsakas are accused of not accepting Isvara. The actual fact is that Mimamsakas do not do Isvara-ninda (even Kumarila paid obeisance), but do not invoke Isvara much.

  

For someone not familiar with all these nuances, Mimamsa seems to be hyper-rational and hence the accusation that you referred to.
