हैतुकान् बकवृत्तींश्च वाङ्मात्रेणापि नार्चयेत् This is present in the Vishnu Puranam, Manu Smriti, etc. The word 'हैतुकः' is given the meaning: a rationalist,A follower of the Mīmāṁsā doctrines.

  

Why is a mimamsaka follower censured?

  

A related question: Were there really followers of Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, etc. doctrines in the past? Are they present now?
To our presentknowledge, we see the above systems being studied by persons who are followers of one or the other vaidika systems.
