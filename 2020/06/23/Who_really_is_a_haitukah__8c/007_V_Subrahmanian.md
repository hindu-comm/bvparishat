Thanks to all scholars who have responded. There is the 'nindaa' of almost all shaastra-s in the Padma Purana, which is well known. It is admitted by aastika-s that it is Veda Vyasa who has penned all the Purana-s. If mimasaka or mimamsa shastram is censurable, nindyam, it is surprising that Jaimini, the purva mimamsaa shaastra pravartaka, himself is admitted by aastika-s as a disciple of Veda Vyasa. And in nyaya mata is censurable, the so many Badarayana Sutras are composed on the syllogism of nyaya: शास्त्रयोनित्वात्, दर्शनात्, अशुद्धमिति चेत्, न, शब्दात्, ....सूर्यकादिवत्, etc. where hetu, drishtaanta ghaTitavaakyam is evident. The Purana that censures these shaastra-s says 'even smaraNam of the saastram is naraka pradam' and so on. It can be understood that the so-called 'rationalists' (there are many today) are nindya-s from the aastika point ofview.
