Subbuji,

  

I checked this verse (MS 4.30) in the Manusmriti with 9 commentaries published by Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan. None of the commentaries interpret 'haituka' as follower of Mimamsa. The commentators unanimaously interpret it as 'वेदविरुद्धतर्कव्यवहारिणः' except Medhatithi who interprets it as नास्तिकाः.
