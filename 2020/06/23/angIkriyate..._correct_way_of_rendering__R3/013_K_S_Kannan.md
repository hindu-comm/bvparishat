What Prof. Deshpande says is quite to the point.

In literature, we see this printed as a single word,  

almost without exception.

  

(The same was the case with ancient Greek where too

words had no gaps in between. And again, it is on account of this that  

the problem of juncture has given rise to many ambiguities,  

and consequent multiple interpretations of not only the terse Brahma-sutra-s,  

but even the Upanishad-s and the Gita etc., which represent the spoken tongue.)

  

In grammatical literature, we see a good deal of ambivalence.

In some texts in fact, where the line has ended with कृष्णी, they have even put a hyphen

\- to underscore the unity of the word, leaving us in no doubt!  

  

Guided perhaps by the fact that  

कृष्णी is considered as the प्रकृति to which the प्रत्यय has been added,

most editors have taken it as a single word.

  

The theoretical grounds presented by Misra-ji are convincing.
