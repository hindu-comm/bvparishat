Dear Prof. Deshpande

  

Are there are examples of non-compounding between *upasarga* and*dhātu* in loka? I know examples from Vedic texts, where sometimes there is no compound between*upasarga*and*dhātu*. In theṚgvedasaṃhitā, we see (mantra 1.83.2, first image):

  

प्राचैर्देवासः प्र णयन्ति देवयुं ब्रह्मप्रियं जोषयन्ते वरा इव  

प्रा॒चैर्दे॒वास॒ः प्र ण॑यन्ति देव॒युं ब्र॑ह्म॒प्रियं॑ जोषयन्ते व॒रा इ॑व

  

Here there appears to be no compound between प्र and नयन्ति, for they are written separately.The *padapāṭha* shows them as two separate *pada*s(प्र । न॒य॒न्ति॒ ।).

  

Contrast this with (mantra 1.129.1, second image):

  

यं त्वं रथमिन्द्र मेधसातयेऽपाका सन्तमिषिर प्रणयसि प्रानवद्य नयसि

यं त्वं रथ॑मिंद्र मे॒धसा॑तयेऽपा॒का संत॑मिषिर प्र॒णय॑सि॒ प्रान॑वद्य॒ नय॑सि

  

Here there appears to be a compound between प्र and नयसि, for they are written together. The*padapāṭha*shows them as a single*pada*(प्र॒ऽनय॑सि), with the compound indicated by the avagraha (ऽ) sign as is usually done in the*padapāṭha*.

  

Outside of Vedic texts, I am unaware of any examples of non-compounding between*upasarga*and*dhātu*.

  

There is णत्व in both these cases (समासेऽपि, असमासेऽपि). Perhaps Vedic examples alone is what Pāṇini had in mind when using असमासेऽपि in उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य? I am not sure, but would like to see *laukika* examples where*upasarga*and*dhātu* are not compounded.

*

Also, while*vyākaraṇa* does not give rules for writing, writing may not be be a faithful representation of speech if *vyākaraṇa*rules are ignored or not consistently followed. In manuscripts/printed editions of*saṃhitāpāṭhas* or*padapāṭha*s,svaras are to be marked with the correct signs, compounds are to be shown by ऽ, etc. So I do not think discussing*vyākaraṇa* on thisthread is completely out of context.

  

This topic is more relevant to a Sanskrit style manual (is there any?) than a Sanskrit grammar book. However, even style manuals have ample discussion on grammar. English punctuation and spacing standards follow English grammar. The single word,*everyday* is an adjective (e.g.*an everyday chores*) while as two words, *every day* is an adverb (e.g. *I study every day*). So why not have Sanskrit punctuation and spacing follow Sanskrit grammar.

  

I am sure we will have disagreements, but that is the beauty of this group. :)

  

Thanks, Nityananda
