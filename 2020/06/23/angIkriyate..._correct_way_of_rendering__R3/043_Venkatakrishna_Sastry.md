Namaste  
  
1. Thanks for giving attnetion to the punctuation issue, which is a print  
generation period problem ( and not the palm leaf writers problem ! What  
medium Kalidasa scribed his work is a debated issue. Modern media projects  
it in visually appelaing ways!) . The suggested hypenation/ separation leads  
to ' chandobhanga'.  
  
I refrain from making observations on your comment ' Malinatha's  
blunder(?) on ' iva-samaasa'. see ' taaveva'- highlighted. should it be  
just a sandhi or also a samaasa ?  
  
2. I am placing the clipping of how Nirnayasagar press gave it to us.  
(<https://archive.org/details/raghuvamsha_with_sanjeevini_commentary_of_malli>  
natha/page/n3/mode/2up) . The 'punctuation format is not uniform , to the  
expectation of word splits as a colonial reader looks for. The flow by  
reading stylized sanskrit, as a flowing speech, chandas is the model used.  
If this is situation in simpler style of Kalidasa,, Bana-bhatta text  
punctuation would be much more complex . and much more complex would be  
shaastra-vyaakhyaanas.
