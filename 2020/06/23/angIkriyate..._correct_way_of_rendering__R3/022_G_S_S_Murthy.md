I am an outsider in this discussion and I am rightly not understanding much.

1\. If it is a matter of how to write, either with space between अङ्गी and करोति or without space, is it not a matter outside the purview of grammar?

2\. Cannot all these be treated similarly? दूरीकरोति, उररीकरोति, अलं चकार, आविर्भवति, अङ्गीकरोति etc?

३. I seek the pardon of scholars. Are such discussions coveredby the well-known क्षौममूल्यविचिन्तनम्?

Thanks and regards,

Murthy
