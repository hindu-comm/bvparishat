There is no doubt that *sup-tiṅ samāsa* occurs. But which grammar source says it occurs in both *veda* and*loka*? Not saying anything on this is not the same as saying something to this effect.

In contrast, *Siddhāntakaumudī* (Bhaṭṭoji Dīkṣita), *Tattvabodhinī* (Jñānendra Sarasvatī), *Vyākaraṇacandrodaya* (Cārudeva Śāstrī), *Bhaimī* (Bhīmasena Śāstrī) all say that*sup-tiṅsamāsa* occurs in *chandas* only or that it is prohibited in *loka*. I have nothing further to add that my position is based on these texts.

*sa ca chandasyeva*in SK 649 does not look like an option, does it? Does any commentary or work support your interpretation of*sa ca chandasyeva*? From its context, the word*sa* in *sa ca chandasyeva* refers to the *tiṅantottarapada samāsa* which is what is mentioned immediately before the quoted sentence.

  

The *svara* rules operate in both *veda* and *loka* (it is a different matter that accent was later lost in *loka*)**so it is not likely that *sa* in *sa ca chandasyeva* is referring to *svara*.

I think it boils down to examples.*paryabhūṣat* is from a Vedic text

  

*devo devān kratunā paryabhūṣat* # RV.2.12.1b;  

  

Other example can be traces. Are there any examples from Laukika texts with*sup-tiṅsamāsa*?
