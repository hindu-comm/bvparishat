May I express a slightly different opinion. As far as the grammatical analysis is concerned, I agree with Shri Nityanand Ji. However, Pāṇini's rules do not describe how to write Sanskrit. They are rules of spoken Sanskrit, and the rule does not say that there are gaps in the utterance of asamasta padas. The Sandhis apply across the stretch of a sentence, as we witness in the recitation of Vedic Saṃhitās or metrical recitations.

Modern writing of Sanskrit with gaps between words is a relatively recent phenomenon guided by editors and publishers influenced in part by the way English is printed with gaps between words. Even English is not spoken with gaps between words. Typical manuscripts do not show gaps between words, and the early printed pothisfrom the Nirnaya Sagara or publishers in Varanasi did not show any gaps between words. Here is an early printed pothi of the Laghusiddhāntakaumudī where the gaps between words are not regularly shown:
