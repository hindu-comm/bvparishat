I did refer to old Greek written with no space between words.

I too thought of the stock example  

godisnowhere, and the two ways of marking off word-boundaries as  

*god is nowhere* and *god is now here.*

I did not go into these details as it would be a digression.

  

When just heard , not written, even these can yield more than one construction/construal :

*I scream/ Ice-cream.*

*Bee-feeder/Beef-eater*

*Great Issues/Gray Tissues*  

  

I had collected all such problems, classified them,  

and written an article called "***anekA(pA)rtha-shAstra***"

while I was at IIT-Kanpur.
