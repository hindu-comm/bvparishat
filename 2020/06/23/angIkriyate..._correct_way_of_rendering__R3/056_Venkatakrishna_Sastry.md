नमस्ते नित्यानन्द मिश्र महोदयाः





The topic is too technical and complex. 



1. I draw your attention to the snippets from url : <http://sanskritdocuments.org/learning_tools/ashtadhyayi/vyakhya/2/2.1.4.htm>
to place on record that grammarians have held 'sup-ting' samasa occurs , it is valid in ' loka' also.



 Regarding \< **स च छन्दस्येव** \> The option part of 'chandasyeva' is for ' svara- nirNaya'. The 'svara' rule operates
only because it is considered as a 'samasa'.

This endorses the 'Samasa' validation in loka use. It does not prohibit 'samasa' in bhahsaa. Regarding 'Chandasi', it is for याज्जिकी विधि- viniyoga of मन्त्र- दर्शन .

 The rule does not apply to ' mantra-darshana' as such ( where no grammar rule operates as vivakshaa). It is a given fact that mortals like me are not able to distinguish mantra darshana and yaajniki viniyoga part of ' given Vedas in 'Karma-Kanda' . One needs to think deeply on Vedanga Vyakarana model and Patanjali dictum 'oohaH khalvapi, vibhaktim kurvanti'.



See Translation part on Sutra 649 of SK at
<https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.136453/page/n401/mode/2up>
and balamanorama explanation of SK.

This is amplified in balamnorama explaining SK. See highlighted.

The view of Kashikaa is clear that sup-ting samasa is valid; and not limited to chandas.

2. Regarding \< In चूडामणीकृतविधुर्वलयीकृतवासुकिः, there is a समास between the च्व्यन्त word चूडामणी and the कृदन्त word कृत (it is notतिङन्त). > I am placing my views below. Schoalrs differe in the interpretation and I respect their opinion.





१. \< In चूडामणीकृतविधुर्वलयीकृतवासुकिः, there is a समास between the च्व्यन्त word चूडामणी and the कृदन्त word कृत (it is notतिङन्त). >



Agreed on the technicality of चूडामणि ( a समस्तपद). This is enhanced to yield the meaning as 'अभूत-तद्भाव-क्रिया’ that which was not , has become now to be that. What is the governing condition ? It is is
'कृभ्वस्तियोगे सम्पद्यकर्तरि च्विः ( ५-४-४० / २११७) operating
before च्वि.



Without the धातु-गर्भ- क्रिया there is no pratyaya and samaasa. Therefore, I feel that the reference goes back to identifying
सामर्थ्य of पद-विधिः which dictates how compounding is to be viewed , as a process and as a ' menaing enhancement- enrichment'. How is vivakshaa translated to prakriyaa ? What is given ? What is taken out ? What remains untouched ?



What is the primary feature in समास ? ? It is operating on
सामर्थ्य of पद-विधिः = (A) सामर्थ्य of पद (B) सामर्थ्य of
विधिः . I am not expanding on the deeper meanings of सामर्थ्य
leading to what will be ' सम- अर्थ’ - समर्थ - सं -अर्थ -- तस्य भावः’.



What is covered in this पद-विधि ? Two parts: One related to अक्षर and another related to अर्थ.



अक्षर-विधि covers सुप्- लोप first and - सुबुत्पत्ति after प्रातिपदिक -संज्ञा प्राप्ति. This process is not taking out the ' धातु-गर्भता’ / धातु-योग of च्व्यन्त. In the present case अस्य च्वौ

takes care of this part. ( Agreed that च्वि is a
तद्राज-तद्धित which is अतिङ् . But 'च्वि’ is coming only after ' धातु-योग - a pointer to ' तिङ्-योग’. )



Now, what will be covered under अर्थ-विधि ? where does the अर्थान्वय / अर्थ -सामर्थ्य / वि वक्षा go for चूडामणि ? Is it going to the कृत्-प्रत्यय or तद्धित प्रत्यय or धात्वर्थ गर्भित तद्धित -प्रत्यय ? without the 'dhaatu ( तिङ्- योग ) the required form of word can not be derived.



Why ? प्रत्यय only enhances and firms up /flavors / modifies the
मूल-प्रकृत्यर्थ / प्रातिपदिकार्थ be it धातु or प्रातिपदिक. It does not take away the original nature of धातु .



Therefore, I feel : सुपां तिङां समासः अर्थ-विधिना - अर्थ-सामर्थ्य- योगेन भाषायामपि भवितुं अर्हति इति ।

एतादृश- चिन्तनं तिङन्त-नामधातु प्रकरणे, प्रत्ययमाला-प्रकरणे अति-सूक्ष्मतया द्रष्टव्यमिति विज्ञापयामि ।
