Namaste



There seems to be two parts in the debated issue here.



*First issue*: Compounding of Sup and ting \< प्रायेण सुपां तिङा **समासो न भवति** \> : Example: चूडामणीकृतविधुर्वलयीकृतवासुकिः



*Second issue*: \< अतो यद्यसमस्तपदानि पृथक्कृत्य लिख्यन्ते तर्हि “कृष्णी करोति”, “अङ्गी क्रियते” इति **पृथग्लेखनमेव साधु**।\> :

Which one would be correct ? \< वागर्थाविवसम्पृक्तौ वागर्थप्रतिपत्तये \> \< वाक्-अर्थौ- इव -संपृतौ , वाक्-अर्थ-प्रति-पत्तये\>





May be the following extract from sarva- samasa-shesha-prakarana augments what has already been told by Prof. Korada.

**My observation** : Learning convenience needs pada-ccheda ;
Lingusitic elegance and grammar compliance needs ' integral articulation and scripting without break'.

Without taking out any credit for great work done by colonial scholars, the violation of this rule of 'pada-cheda' is rampant in print documents of several sanskrit-english lexicons,

starting from celebrated Monier Williams.



 This 'pada-cheda' approach in lexicon-text publication, seems to have been introduced as convenience to facilitate word-split marks for a learning convenience ; for speciifc audience 

beyond-india learners and researchers, for whom Paninian langauge was 'an artificial construct to express thought, in an ornate classical way'.

This pedagogy was not meant to groom skills for ' use of Sanskrit' for creative composition like that of
Valmiki, Vyasa, Kalidasa' or be a crowd member of audience (prekshaka-

saamajika -sahrudaya) which enjoyed the 'dasha-roopakas ( with Samskruth-Prakrtuh mix).
