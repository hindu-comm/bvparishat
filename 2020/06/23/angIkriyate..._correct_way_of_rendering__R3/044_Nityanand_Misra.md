In चूडामणीकृतविधुर्वलयीकृतवासुकिः, there is a समास between the च्व्यन्त word चूडामणी and the कृदन्त word कृत (it is notतिङन्त). This is possible as Bhimasena Shastri, Charudeva Shastri, etc. have stated. The example चूडामणीकृत is similar to the example कृष्णीकृत given by Bhimasena Shastri in the Bhaimi.

  

The usually cited examples of a compound between सुबन्त and तिङन्त words are पर्यभूषयत् and अनुव्यचलत्. But these samasas are seen only in Vedas (not in Loka), as Siddhantakaumudi says: **’सह’ इति योगो विभज्यते। सुबन्तं समर्थेन सह समस्यते। योगविभास्येष्टसिद्ध्यर्थत्वात्कतिपयतिङन्तोत्तरपदोऽयं समासः। स च छन्दस्येव। पर्यभूषयत्। अनुव्यचलत् ।** This is the reason why Bhimasena Shastri saysक्योंकि **लोक में** सुबन्त का तिङन्त के साथ समास वर्जित है.

The example**पर्यभूषयत्** is given in Siddhantakaumudi with the rider that such samasas are in Vedas only, not in Loka.

  

Thanks, Nityananda
