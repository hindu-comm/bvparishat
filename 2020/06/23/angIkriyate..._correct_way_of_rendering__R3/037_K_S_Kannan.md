I took a quick glance through the book  

***अनुवाद-कला*** of Charudeva Shastri  

(1989, Motilal Banarsidass),

as indicated by Sri Krishnaprasad G-ji.

  

I came across 4 instances where we find  

the verbal form shown as a single word!

p.18 विर**सीभ**वन्ति  

p.86 स**मीकु**रु  

p.20 व्याकु**लीभूः**  

p.20 सा**धूभ**विष्यति .

**Hence the statement that Charudeva Shastri has shown such instances  
**

***as separate words* in the book अनुवाद-कला is not borne out.**

  

(Of course, we have no problem with  

p\. 22 परोपकर**णीकृ**तकायाः

as it involves a कृदन्त).
