I attest four references from **grammatical** literature,

where we can find the **hyphen** printed at the end of the line

indicating the continuation of the same word:

  

1\. Hyphen after कृष्णी appearing at the end of the line,  

followed by भवति in the next line  

which conveys the clear idea that it is a single word:

p.939, line 21,  

**1910 edition, edited and published by  
**

**S.Chandrasekhara Sastrigal, Teppakulam**

***Siddhanta Kaumudi* with *Balamanorama***

  

2.गङ्गी followed by hyphen, followed by  

स्यात् in the next line:  

p.654, line 7 from the bottom,

**ed. Giridhara Sharma & Paramesvarananda Sharma,**

***Vaiyakarana Siddhanta Kaumudi***

***(*with *Balamanorama* and *Tattvabodhini)  
***

**2006, Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi.**

  

3.दिवा followed by hyphen, followed by  

भूता रात्रिः

line 4 from the bottom,

same book as above.

  

4\. पटू followed by hyphen, followed by  

करोति in the next line:  

p.311, line 6,

***Kasika*, with *Nyasa* & *Padamanjari***

**(ed.) Tripathi JSL, & Bhattacharya B,**

**1994, Tara Book Agency, Varanasi.**
