Thank you for these citations from

*Vyakarana-candrodaya*, Vol. 2 of Charudeva Shastri.

  

This was first published in 1970,

whereas *Anuvada-kala* was first published in 1950.

  

*Anuvada-kala* has undergone  

2nd edition in 1956,  

3rd edition in 1970 and  

a mere reprint in 1989.

  

One must only remark that it is unfortunate that  

authors do not sometimes take adequate care to see that  

errors in previous editions are not repeated in subsequent editions.

  

Thanks again for bringing in *Vyakarana-candrodaya*.

  

This has become a sort of  

*uttarottaram prAmANyam!*
