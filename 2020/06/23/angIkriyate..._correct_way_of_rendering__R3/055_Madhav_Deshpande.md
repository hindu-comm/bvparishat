Dear Nityanand Ji,

  

  This is a great question. I am speaking historically. As far as I know, rules likeउपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य in Panini are not limited to Vedic language. Exceptions for Vedic usage, like छन्दसि परेऽपि, व्यवहिताश्च "In the Vedic language, the upasargas can occur even after the verbs and there can be other words in-between" are explicitly stated. All other rules apply to both छन्दस् and भाषा alike. What we consider as the classical language is largely a post-Paninian development, where the svaras are lost and compounds become longer and longer. Patterns of writing Sanskrit are not dictated by Panini's rules, but develop over centuries as conventions, sometimes slightly different in different regions. So, by convention, the upasargas are now written not only before the verb, but always with sandhi. What I am saying is that this is the post-Paninian convention, but the sandhi is not required by Panini's rules. We can of course discuss as to which conventions are proper or useful, but citing Panini is not always useful. With best regards,
