Namaste



1. The discussion on the \< a compound between सुबन्त and तिङन्त
\> is getting more interesting.



2. I am picking the observation from Prof. Koradas post below and constructing a conversation context.

\< So if one says -- शुक्ली भवति -- can people get the
intended sense -- 'अशुक्लं शुक्लं संपद्यमानं भवति ' ? or they will
understand as - the lady called शुक्ली is there ?\>



3. The constructed local context is placed below:



 आपणे संस्कृतम् : लेपनस्यास्य नियतं उपयोगेन **शुक्लीभवति**
त्वक् । कृष्णा अकृष्णा भवति । **त्वचः अकृष्णीकरणार्थं** **/
अकृष्णीभवितुं **अस्माकं लेपनं क्रीणातु भवान् / भवती



 Sanskrit-Shop: (Sales Talk- Intention ) : By regular use of this cream-paste, skin ( which was not that white before) becomes white ( after use).

Dark
complexioned (lady) become fair and white complexioned.

Madam , To loose your darker (skin tone) and become fair and white , please buy our product cream-paste.



4. ***The question*** : Is the Samskruth expression truly, totally bringing out the ' intention' presented in the worldly conversation ?
If Yes, what rule ? If not, what should be the construction?
