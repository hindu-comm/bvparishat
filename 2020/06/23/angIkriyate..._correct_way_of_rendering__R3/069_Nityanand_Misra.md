I was able to trace the source of अनुव्यचलत् also. The compounded usage अनुव्यचलत् occurs in the 14th ‘sūkta’ of the 15th ‘kāṇḍa’ of the Atharvaveda-saṃhitā. In each of the twelve mantras of this ‘sūkta’, we see the uncompounded usage “अनु व्यचलत्” and also the compounded usage “अनुव्यचलत्” as is evident form the ‘svara’ and ‘padapāṭha’ differences (attached image). It appears this “अनुव्यचलत्” example is also limited to *chandas*, to account for the different ‘svara’ from the uncompounded case.
