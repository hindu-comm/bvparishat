Apologies, what I wrote above is not correct. Paṇḍita Īśvaracandra explains in his commentary on*Siddhāntakaumudī*that \[in*loka*,\] the compounding is betweenउपसर्ग and कृदन्त forms but not between उपसर्ग andतिङन्त forms. If we follow his explanation (which I agree with after some thought), there is a compound/समास in usages likeप्रकृत्य but not in usages like प्रकरोति. In both cases there isसंहिता, which isनित्य in both aसमास and between a धातु and an उपसर्ग (नित्या धातूपसर्गयोः, नित्या समासे). So the use of असमासे in उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य seemingly accounts forणत्व when there is a तिङन्त**form following an उपसर्ग (उपसर्गात्). The examples in काशिका (highlighted in red) are noteworthy: णोपदेशस्य धातोर्यो नकारस्तस्योपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्य णकारादेशो भवत्यसमासेऽपि समासेऽपि। प्रणमति। परिणमति। प्रणायकः। परिणायकः।Here first two (प्रणमति and परिणमति) are examples of असमासेऽपि and last two (प्रणायकः and परिणायकः) are examples of समासेऽपि.सिद्धान्तकौमुदी gives examples of असमासेऽपि only (प्रणदति and प्रणिनदिति).

  

In च्व्यन्त + तिङन्त usages likeअङ्गी क्रियते there is neither a समास nor is there नित्यसंहिता as अङ्गी is not an उपसर्ग. So I guess in past tense both अङ्गी अकरोत् and अङ्ग्यकरोत् should be theoretically correct, as the संहिता here depends on one's विवक्षा. In contrast, प्र अकरोत् would be incorrect and प्राकरोत्only would be correct as there is a नित्यसंहिता here).

  

These are my current thoughts after going through various sources. Would be useful to know what commentaries or other authors say on this issue.
