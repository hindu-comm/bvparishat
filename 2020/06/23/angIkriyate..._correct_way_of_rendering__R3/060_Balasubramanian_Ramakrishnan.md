Dear list members,

  

This has been a very interesting thread to follow. Something to add to what Prof. Deshapande says below. There is an interesting book “Moonwalking with Einstein” by Joshua Foer, which talks about the art of memorization. It is a very good and entertaining read and one of the chapters talks about the use of white space in manuscripts. Apparently this is a very late innovation, relatively speaking, even in the West. He points

out that even reading from a text meant that the text was mostly memorized because of lack of punctuation and white space. I attach a shot of a couple of the pages for yourreference.

  

Ramakrishnan
