I agree with Prof. Deshpande, there is nothing inPāṇini’s rules to mandate a space between asamasta words. That is a modern typographical convention to help readability. My point is that there should be consistency in following this convention. What I meant was if uncompounded words are written separately with a gap in between (यद्यसमस्तपदानि पृथक्कृत्य लिख्यन्ते), then then usages should also be written separately (तर्हि “कृष्णी करोति”, “अङ्गी क्रियते” इति पृथग्लेखनमेव साधु) due to lack of a compound between the words.

  
I am attaching a screenshot of a page from the book comment Pātañjala Yogadarśana. This is one of the rare books which prints such words separately. The editor, Vyākaraṇācārya Rāmaśaṅkara Bhaṭṭācārya, clarifies this in the highlighted footnote.

  

Dr. Kannan’s observation is correct that most books print such usages as single words. But they should be printed as two separate words.
