Nityanandji,

I wanted to share that अङ्गी is used as a separate word in old Odia as we see evidence

Sarala Das's Mahabharata (15th century). it is used mostly in the sense on truce between

warring parties (Sarala creates arbitrary wars). It is also used in marriage decisions like  

svayamvara. In odia अङ्गीकार is a later word. I don't see its use in poetry.

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
