Sir

  

It has to be interpreted as naaTakam is the pinnacle of kavitvam. Why? Due to the weight of tradition, as quoted by two stalwarts of this group.

  

That said, there is a reason for the existence of the other view. Even an ordinary poem when sung well, still gives a lot of joy. So, especially in the last hundred years or so, a lot of ordinary poetry when recited mellifluously received a lot of appreciation. However that was die to the inability of the listeners to distinguish music and poetry. So this would have given rise to the new interpretation of naaTakaantam kavitvam.

  

If we go by Natyasastra, when the highest forms of poetry, music, dress, props, acting, and dance combine we get the best Natakam. So, Natakam is indeed the pinnacle of kavitvam.

  

Regards

N Siva Senani

  

PS: To the best of my knowledge, the source of naaTakaantam kavitvam is not the Natyasastra.
