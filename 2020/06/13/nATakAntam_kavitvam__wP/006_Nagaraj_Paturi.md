श्रव्यकाव्यम्‌ and दृश्यकाव्यम्‌ (नाटकम्‌ ) both have arguments in their favor.

  

Statements such as काव्येषु नाटकं रम्यं should just be taken as artha vaada.

  

\> नाटकान्तम् कवित्वम्" (Nāṭakāntam kavitvam നാടകാന്തം കവിത്വം) is a phrase that has been used a good many times in modern Malayalam literature.

  

Yes, it is in modern times that such expressions became popular.

  

It is particularly understandable in Kerala where the stage performance of Sanskrit plays has been vibrantly surviving.

  

Search forनाटकान्तम् कवित्वम् did not yield results.
