"नाटकान्तम् कवित्वम्" (Nāṭakāntam kavitvam നാടകാന്തം കവിത്വം) is a phrase that has been used a good many times in modern Malayalam literature. I remember my high school Malayalam teacher explaining it thus: Drama is at the pinnacle of literature. Drama starts where poetry ends, meaning poetry, refined further, is drama. But I have also seen it explained differently - poetry starts where drama ends, meaning poetry is a literary form more refined than drama. What is the correct interpretation of this phrase? Has this phrase been taken from Bharata Muni'sNāṭyaśāstra?
