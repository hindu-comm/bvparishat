I tried searching"नाटकान्तं कवित्वम्" and got few pages of results, several were quoting along काव्येषु नाटकं रम्यम् from pages from books.

  

In fact some commentators from Kerala have tried showing the Sandhi and Sandhyanga applicable from Natyashastra to Kavyas like Raghvamsha though they do not mention of these charectics of Nataka. But Bhavaprakashana and later rhetercians deal with both poetry and drama.
