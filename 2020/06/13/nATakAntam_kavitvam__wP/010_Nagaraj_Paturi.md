Thanks respected Dr Ganesh-ji for mentioning this from Bhaamaha. I have been struggling on several occasions and forums to remove this notion of 'Pancha sandhi analysis applies only to Naatakam' that has crept in for some reason.

  

That is an itivritta/plot analysis that is common for both s'ravyaand dris'ya kaavya.

  

On another list, there was almost a consensus that in Sanskrit literature, there is no plot / narrative structure analysis when I had to bring in Pancha Sandhi and face responses on the lines of 'it applies to Roopakas / Naatakasonly' etc.

  

In the west , the five part analysis, that is today taught at schools including film schools , though is recognized as coming from Drama, is applied to all narrative literary genres including film stories.

  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#History>  

In 1863, around the time that playwrights likeHenrik Ibsenwere abandoning the 5-act structure and experimenting with 3 and 4-act plays, theGermanplaywright and novelist Gustav Freytag wrote*Die Technik des Dramas*, a definitive study of the 5-act dramatic structure, in which he laid out what has come to be known as Freytag's pyramid.^([\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#cite_note-fall3-3))Under Freytag's pyramid, the plot of a story consists of five parts:^([\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#cite_note-fall4-4)[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure#cite_note-5))

1.  Exposition(originally called introduction) 2.  Rising action(rise) 3.  Climax 4.  Falling action(return or fall) 5.  Catastrophe,denouement, resolution, orrevelation

Pancha Sandhi analysis is much much older, more complex, more elaborate and meticulous. People did not remember to mention. When I mentioned, they resisted applying it to non-drama literary genres.
