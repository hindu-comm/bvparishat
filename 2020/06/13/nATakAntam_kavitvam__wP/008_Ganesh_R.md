Namaskaara,

  

For that matter, Bhaamaha himself, while discussing the lakShaNa-s a mahaakaavya, mentions that all the five sandhi-s are to be incorporated in it.

  

With regards

  

Ganesh

  

P.S. Nowhere in the naaTyaSaastra, Bharata mentions anything about the superiority of dRSyakaavya over Sravyakaavya. Even the well known dictum naaTakaantam kavitvam is not found in the works if illustrious aalamkaarika-s.
