Poetry sans the ineluctable descriptions and the narrative mode,

bears copious kinship with the art of the stage.

  

And as to the net effect, and speaking adhering to the traditional norms,

while *kAntA-sammitatva* can apply to both genres in equal measure,

the *kAnta-cAkShuSha-kratutva* of drama is propounded by the seers themselves.
