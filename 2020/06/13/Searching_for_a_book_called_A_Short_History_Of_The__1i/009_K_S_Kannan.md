Another excellent work on Purva-mimamsa is

*Prakarana-pancika* published from Varanasi,

the introduction to which too is very clear and inspiring.

  

Scholars who excel in their knowledge of Sanskrit and English

*plus a sastra,* rare though they are, are treasures for us.

Command over more than one language, and felicity of expression therein

add to effectively and powerfully convey even abstruse concepts.
