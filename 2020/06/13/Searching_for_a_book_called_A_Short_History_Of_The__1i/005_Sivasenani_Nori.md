What a treasure this Introduction is! Thank you, Prof. Kannan.

  

Let me give a short note and an extract from the 150-page long "Short History of Purva Mimamsa" so that others might get an idea of what it contains.

  

The author V. A. Ramaswami Sastri divides the period under consideration in three parts: pre-Kumarila, the Kumarila period 600-900 AD ending with Vacaspati Misra, and the post-Kumarila period. He starts with a surveyof usage of the word 'mimaamsaa' in the Veda and then deals with the Kumarila period at some length. Then in the post-Kumarila period many authors on the Mimamsa system are introduced, many of the works being unpublished. **This section may be of interest to Prof. Nagaraj Paturi garu** who had once compiled a list of major Sanskrit works post Mammata, and especially post 15th century, to dispute Pollock's thesis that Sanskrit was dead. Let me end this with a few extracts from the last page of the short history:

  

"In the fore-going pages I have endeavoured to give a brief survey of the history of the Purva Mimamsa Sastra and tried to notice nearly *seventy* authors, more than half of whom are practically unknown to the studentsof Sanskrit. The reason for this is obvious: their works are not published."

  

I like the last sentence a lot, especially one word, 'short' :-)

  

"A full discussion of the doctrinal side of the history of the Purva Mimamsa System I have purposefully omitted in this short Introduction."

  

The next fifty pages 'analyse' the Tattvabindu, the book proper as advertised in the title.

  

Regards

N. Siva Senani
