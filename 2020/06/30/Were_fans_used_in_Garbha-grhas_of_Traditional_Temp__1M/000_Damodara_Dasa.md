Hare Krishna.  
  
Respected Vidvaj-janas,  
Pranams.  
  
At our vedic village we do not use electric fans as we do not use  
electricity. In summer it becomes quite uncomfortable to sleep inside  
house and thus we all sleep outside, in the compound, below open sky.  
That is very enjoying and nice.  
  
However, we have a small temple of Lord Krishna. All day we have nice  
services going on there with about 100 devotees taking part in three  
aratis and kirtana.  
  
Now the Lord stays in the garbhagrha even at night when He goes to  
shayana. We feel it quite embarassing that we are sleeping in nice  
breeze below open sky while our Lord is inside garbha-grha which  
doesn't even have a fan. So we started thinking to do something. In  
course of our discussions we tried to ponder over what, in  
pre-electricity days, temples used to do. We all know that people used  
to sleep outside and that's a simple solution. We could think of two  
solutions:  
1. Make an arrangement for the Lord to sleep outside like us.  
2. Make an arrangement for traditional type Fan hanging from ceiling  
of Garbha-grha and have a rope hanging outside it by which devotees  
can swing the fan, turn by turn. There is a similar arrangement in  
Dakor, Gujarat, although nowadays that is not much used.  
  
So I wanted to know what traditional temples used to do in  
pre-electricity days when there is uncomfortablly hot summer.  
  
Thankyou,  
Your servant,  
damodara das
