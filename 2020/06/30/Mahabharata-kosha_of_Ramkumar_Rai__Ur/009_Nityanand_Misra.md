Got the book from Chaukhambha finally.

  

महाभारतकोशः. Dr. Ramkumar Rai. Second edition (Vikram Samvat 2067):
Chaukhambha Sanskrit Series Office, Varanasi. Hardcover, 739 pp.

  

It is a work of immense dedication and marvelous perfectionism. It is a must-have resource for writers and researchers on the Mahābhārata. I have attached some photos of the book.

  

Note: Only the title and preface are in Sanskrit, the book is in Hindi.
