Dear Sivaprasad ji,

 I wish to bring it to your kind notice that I have collected pravachanams (From YouTube) on "Srimad Bhagavatam" in Telugu by Brahmasri Malladi Chandrasekara Sastri garu, Brahmasri Sri Bhashyam Appalachari garu (Sanskri based for 21 days) and Brahmasri Chaganti Koteswara Rao garu (Potana Bhagavatam for 42 days and Saptaham). Kindly let me know if they are of interest to you. Then we shall see a feasible way to share the contents. I don't really know the meaning ofshreedhareeya or veera raghaveeya or Subodhini teeka.

With best regards  
Suresh
