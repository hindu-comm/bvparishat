Respected scholars ,

     

I want to know any CDs/ DVDs of Bhagavatam with shreedhareeya or veera raghaveeya or Subodhini teeka explanations available ?

  

I failed to locate a good one.

  

Please tell me the details if anyone knows .

  

Nearly 1000 people are listening bhagavtam in the APR BHAGAVATAM WHATSAPP groups in which admins are placing recitation audio on first day and the reading the translation on the next day. Totally it's going on in 6-7 languages at present .

  

This is the second round of study.

On first round of study we recited a chapter a day .

At present we are reading a chapter a day and the translation on the next day in 6 languages.

  

On third round we have an interest to read it with a commentary.

  

So please tell the details of the recording of commentary lessons of complete bhagavatam in CDs and DVDs.

  

Thank You.
