Thanks Kushagra Ji for your insight. Do you think that the choice of metre could also have a linkage with the effect it has on the learner's mind? Given that many of theshastras were meant to be transmitted orally and memorized, it would be interesting to understand why a specific metre was chosen, apart from the reason you shared, which I'm sure is a major contributor.I'm assuming this would be a major area of focus in the fieldof Chhandas. I would love to hear any comments on this topic.

  

Regards,

Nikhil
