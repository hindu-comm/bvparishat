Dear Shri Nikhil Ji,

  

I have subsequently learnt that the ubiquitousness ofशार्दूलविक्रीडितम् in astrology texts such as फलदीपिका and बृहज्जातकम् has been attributed to the versatilityof this meter as well as its significance in Jyotisha. Indeed, Varahamihira implies that he consciously chose the meters for his text: वृत्तविचित्रमर्थबहुलम्.

  

शार्दूलविक्रीडितम् is significant because, according to its lakshana (सूर्याश्वैर्मसजास्ततः सगुरवः शार्दूलविक्रीडितम्), it is constructed as 12 (सूर्य) + 7 (अश्व). As you know, both are very important numbers in Jyotisha. Moreover, the sun is regarded as the ruler of the planetary system.

  

Best,

Kushagra
