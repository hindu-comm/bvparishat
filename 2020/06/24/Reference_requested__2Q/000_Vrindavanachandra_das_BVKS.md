Dear Vidvans,

Hare Krishna.

  

We have commissioned an artist to paint a series on Ramayana. We are looking for a reference(s) and would be grateful if any of the knowledgeable vidvans can help us with the same.

  

We see that in most of the traditional Indian paintings Hanuman is depicted wearing a crown. Is there any reference in Valmiki (or other) Ramayana about Hanuman wearing a crown?

  

Thanks in advance,

  

Vrindavana Chandra Das
