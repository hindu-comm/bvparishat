Thanks Dr. Kannan for pointing out the typo.  

  

I realized the error after I hit the send.

  

Any way, the point was to highlight the contraindications of turmeric and utilizing the product correctly.

  

Recognizing the popularity of Turmeric Extract, many companies are selling Turmeric Juice and Paste in India as well as US unfortunately, not recognizing the adverse events associated with Oxalic acid contents in turmeric that leads to the formation of Kidney Stones.  

  

I would thus recommend the consumption of turmeric extract rather than just the spice.  

  

Rgds
