Dear List:

  

"May be good for Kovid-19"  

  

Animal studies of curcumin on viral infections suggests that the coronavirus enters human cells through the ACE2 receptor by attaching its spike protein (S). Curcumin could at least partially prevent that entry as inferred from *in silico*docking studies. A potential inhibitory effect on the main protease of the coronavirus is also reported in an*in silico*study in the literature. The multi-mechanistic modes of action are the forte of curcumin in various types of virus infections. The paper cites several studies wherein curcumin is effective in pulmonary -inflammation, -fibrosis, and -edema. The positive role of curcumin played out under the cytokine storm conditions during viral infections is also discussed. The review touches on the recuperative actions of curcumin on cardiac and kidney functional damage caused by viral infections. Curcumin’s role in mitigating the morbid acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during viral infections, as demonstrated in animal models, is also reviewed. The outstanding antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin are the basis of their activity.  

  

Thus, our common spice holds a great potential for many deceases and conditions.

**CAUTION**: Consumption of Turmeric spice is attributed to the formation of Kidney Stones associated with Oxalic contents. So, one needs to be aware of this as well.
