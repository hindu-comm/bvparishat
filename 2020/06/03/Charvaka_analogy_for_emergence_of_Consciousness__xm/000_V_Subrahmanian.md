In the Charvaka darshana, we have the example of intoxicating power emerging from ingredients that go to make liquor, though the mada shakti is not there in any of the individual ingredients.

The above is from the Sarvadarshanasangraha of Madhavacharya.

  

But then there is another popular analogy, of betel leaves, nut, chunam, etc. not having the red colour, but in combination bring it out: Here is one article:

// found always associated with the body and vanishes when the body disintegrates. Consciousness is supposed to arise in the same way as the red colour is produced by the combination of betel leaf, nut and lime, or is the result of mixing up of the white with yellow or again as the power of intoxications is generated in molasses. “Prithvyaptejo vayur iti tattvani, tatsamudaye sarirendriyavisaya samjfisl, tebhyah caiianyam, kinvaadibhyo madasaktivad vijnanam.” (Barhaspatyani sutrani)2 //  

  

I would like to know if there is any textual source for the betel leaf example.

  

Thanks and regards
