नमो विद्वद्भ्यः

  

Thank you Vid Yadu -- cur cumin ( a constituent of Turmeric ) is well explained . As you rightly pointed out same is

the case with other ingredients used in conditioning a curry etc. - Rider - **अति सर्वत्र वर्जयेत्** ।

  

**ताम्बूलम्** ---

  

तांबूलम् is useful as a किण्व -- there are references in ancient Indian literature -- poets apart from वेश्य-s (concubines)

were consuming ताम्बूलम् --

  

**श्रीहर्ष** declares that he was offered two ताम्बूलम्-s and a seat by the ruler of कान्यकुब्ज (**नैषधम् - 22 last verse**) ---

  

**ताम्बूलद्वयमासनं च लभतेयःकान्यकुब्जेश्वरात्**

  

**Peddana** , the author of **मनुचरित्रमु (स्वारोचिषमनुसम्भवमु)** , one of the Telugu पञ्चकाव्य-s and the court-poet of Srikrishnadevaraya (1500 AD ) demanded -

  

a **कर्पूरतांबूलम्** (कर्पूर=camphor ) that too handed over by a प्रियदूतिका and so on -- **प्रियदूतिक तेच्चियिच्चु कप्पुरविडेमु ..**..

  

The Emperor actually handed over such a ताम्बूलम् to Peddana .

  

ताम्बूलम् - is offered even in **ऋत्विग्वरणम्** etc - rites .

  

During earlier centuries (even now in some pockets) , both ladies and gents have the habit of consuming तांबूलम्

after meals .Many other ingredients are also there .

  

It generates a strong **चैतन्यम्** in both mind and body .

  

धन्यो’स्मि
