Respected Shri Shankaraji!  

  

Sribhashyam with Srutaprakasika\[and vedanta deepa, sara\] in Telugu script published in 1908 by Paravastu Ramanujacharya is required in pdf or image form.  

I got a file "2015.491415.SriSarirakaMimamsaBrahmaSutraBhasyamMidam"

but that has only chapters 2 to 4.

Do you have access to the first part \[1st chapter\] of the book?

  

Thanks and regards
