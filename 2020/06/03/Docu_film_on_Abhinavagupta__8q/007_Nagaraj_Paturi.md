Hi Rita-ji,

  

Thanks for sharing this IGNCA documentary, a testimonies) on Abhinavagupta's life and achievements.

  

What struck me in this unabashed hagiography was the by now commonplace attribution of his consummate enlightenment to thespiritual state of his parents at the moment of conception. His all-consuming quest is dramatically portrayed as having been triggered by the inner void left by the loss of his beloved mother at a tender impressionable age. Some here might recall that the wandering ≈öa·πÖkarƒÅcƒÅrya broke the rules of his renunciate (*sannyƒÅsa*) order by returning to cremate his mother: the subsequent outpouring of devotional hymns,including to the Great Goddess, from the heart of this otherwise 'dry' philosopher is sometimes attributed to this 'traumatizing' event.

  

As regards Prof. Arindam Chakrabarti's excellent presentation, many of its points and arguments were elaborated in his essay,"From*Vimar≈õa*to*Vi≈õrama*: You, I and the Tranquil Taste of Freedom" in*[Abhinavagupta: Reconsiderations](http://www.svabhinava.org/abhinava/AbhinavaguptaReconsiderations/index.php)*(2006, pp.282-304). that I (guest-) edited (with Makarand Paranjape). Though already in the public domain, the book has been unfortunately out-of-print (you might have to petition the speaker for a PDF copy...).

  

Within the short span of an hour-and-a-half, he succeeded in sharing a comprehensive sampling of Abhinava's multifaceted personality and wide range of talents. Approaching (the significance of) his genius through the reconciliation, and thereby transcendence, of seven fundamental aporias ('contradictions') in (not just Hindu) philosophical thought was Arindam's own stroke of genius.Prof. Rastogi'ssubsequent objection to his equating*camatkƒÅra*(aesthetic relish) to*vismaya*(surprise) is perhaps amenable to a similar dialectic...
