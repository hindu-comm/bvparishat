Saw this on Facebook today ðŸ™‚. Reminded me of some papers that I have read which were authored by PhD students. Their guides might have set a target of x number of papers in y months. Perhaps some of those x number of papers might have turned out to be like the above.ðŸ˜ƒ. Well not all such papers were mathematically oriented. Some of those papers were in non-science subjects.
