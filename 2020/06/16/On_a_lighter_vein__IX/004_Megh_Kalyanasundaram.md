*Ganita vs formal mathematics: re-examining mathematics, its pedagogy, and the implications for science C. K. Raju, Tagore Fellow, Indian Institute of Advanced Study* *(*<http://ckraju.net/papers/IIAS-Seminar-abstract.pdf>):"While formal math does not add ANYTHING to the practical value of math (for science and engineering, from rockets to artificial intelligence, which practical value all comes from normal math) it adds greatly to the DIFFICULTY of math: e.g. most people (including most professional mathematicians) would be unable to prove even 1+1=2 (in “real” numbers) from first principles (without assuming even set theory). Try it! :)"
