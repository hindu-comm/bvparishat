I am a Sri Lankan Monk and now I am completing my Mphil thesis in Sanskrit from the department of Classical Languages, University of Peradeniya. Since my B.A. degree level, I was searching for a Sanskrit Textbook on Aucityavicaracarca. There is not any completed English or Sinhala book in my university library. I looked recently published books named Aucityavicaracarca in your country through the websites. Therefore, can you help me to receive an English translated book on Aucityavicaracarca from your country?

  

With best wishes,

Ven.K.Seelananda
