Dear friends,

  

Good morning,

Through our efforts here, we are launching the preparation of a digital portal

on India education for the youth and public world-wide. The database for the

portal is completed this morning. Through this note I am inviting scholars  

who might be able to review the database and suggest additions. The database

is from Indus to the present to help digitize India's known cultural history

for public outreach and prepare modules for high school classes.  

  

Please do write to me if you would like to act as an Advisor or Consultant to

the project. We are a thirty person team and would be looking for educators

world-wide who might have interest in public education.Our work would involve  

collecting evidentiary material, field research and design of user interface

through AI protocol. We plan to release the portal for test in 2022. A formal

Education Center is being negotiated with the City of Boston.  

  

Please write to me personally if you would like to join the project.  

  

Best regards,

Bijoy Misra
