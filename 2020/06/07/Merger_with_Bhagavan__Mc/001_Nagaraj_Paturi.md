'Merger' is only a narrative imagery.

  

The s'aastreeya theory of moksha at least in Vis'ishTaadvaita is not just describable that way.

  

Cases such as those of aaNDaal have even more different explanation.

  

We have learner scholars from that school here. Let us wait for guidance from them.

  

Meera Bai is a different issue.
