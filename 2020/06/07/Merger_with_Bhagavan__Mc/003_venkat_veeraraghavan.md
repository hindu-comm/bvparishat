Sir...

Tukaram was taken away by Vishnu dutas was what was recorded.  
He therefore did not leave a body. Or did he?

Vallalar of Vadalur demonstrated the nuanced refinement of the bodily sheaths in his lifetime.shuddha, pranava, jnana deham etc.  
He ultimately disintegrated without leaving anything behind.

It is my belief that Aandal and Meera were yoginis of a high order who did not leave behind a gross body.  
This is a kind of yogaishvaryam.

Interestingly Sri Krishna Himself the yogeshvara left His body in order to show people the course of life and death.
