In the specific lives of Mira Bai and Aandal we hear that they ultimately 'merged' with their chosen deity. This may be called 'aikyam'. Is there any study or record by authentic schools as to the state of these exemplary devotees *after* such merger as to whether their individual identity would remain distinct from that of Bhagavan?
The question arises because in all Bhakti schools, the moksha is in a specific dhaama of Bhagavan and the distinction is admitted. In the stated cases there is no such going to that dhama but merger here, in this life itself, after which they are not believed to be seen here. Any inputs on this is welcome.

  

Are there any other instances of such 'merger'?
