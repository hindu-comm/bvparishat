No. No hagiographer said that Tukaram's body disappeared into thin air from visible to invisible. The narratives give the picture of Tukaram travelling to Vaikuntha while everyone was watching with all their eyes wide open.

  

These narratives compel the element of 'while everyone was watching with all their eyes wide open' through the other narrative elements such as Panduranga promising that to happen that way, some of the onlookkers going and informing his wife about the astonishing event being watched by all and it getting delayed by the time the wife reached there etc.

  

In most of these legends, the Bhakti towards these saints gets reinforced through repeated remembering and narration of elements such as "while everyone was watching with all their eyes wide open".
