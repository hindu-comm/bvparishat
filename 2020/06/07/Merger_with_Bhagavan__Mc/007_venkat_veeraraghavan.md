 Dear Dr. Ravi,  

  

Shri Paturi garu has given an excellent response to this conspiracy theory.

  

Now hypothetically buying into the paradigm of caste-hatred as propounded by these urban legends,

I would dispute that Tukaram was a dvija (a vaishya). He was a contemporary of Eknath and Jnanoba who were both ostensibly from Brahmin kulas. He was a contemporary of Sw Samartha Ramdas.

There is an extensive oral tradition of Tuka's interaction with his contemporaries and none of these show bigotry of the sort you mention.

All these people freely mixed with the lowest of the low.

If any should have had a grouse against Tuka it must have been his long suffering wife who had to run a household with nothing in the midst of many a famine.

  

This canard is right up there with the Karna was a low caste Suta jibe that modern versions of Mahabharata peddle, ignoring the fact that Adhiratha Sutas were varna sankaras of Brahmins and Kshatriyas. And that Karna was accepted as Drona's disciple and there was no problem castewisein his tutelage.

  

I think people need to build up narratives to give themselves avictim complex.

In any case all these people were much beyond notions of jaati.

When a person in Bharatavarsha displays yogaishvaryathe casteist elements stay aloof to avoid messing with what they do not understand.

The Nagar Brahmans who mocked Jnanobawhen he went with his siblings to ask for upanayana and acceptance had to fall at his feet when he made a buffalo recite the veda.

  

There is no point resurrecting these canards in any respectable group since even considering this leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
