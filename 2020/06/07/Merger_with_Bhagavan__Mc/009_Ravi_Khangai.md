I do agree with the views expressed by the scholars. The theory of murder by the Brahmin seems to be a polemic. I mentioned it on this platformbecauseI was curious how the scholars take it. I am not taking any stand as of now.. I also wanted to highlighthow the narratives are twisted. The cause of concern is also that many of my students in the department get carried away with these kindsof politicallymotivated narratives.
