But Sri G S S Murthy-ji,

  

Please remember that those who believe in the moksha version and travel to Vaikuntha version are on the same page as the person about whom they are talking.

  

They are talking about Tukaram's life after death as per the philosophy of life after death as expressed in his abhangas.

  

The person being talked about and the people talking about him are in sync.
