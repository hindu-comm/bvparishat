Prof.Paturi,

  

You have done a wonderful job in answering this query and the new view to look at old facts. Congrats .

  

There are intelligent and fertile brains in Modern Maharashtrian scholarship which are trying to establish new theories to explain the old historical facts to suit to their thinking,which is palatable to the political big wigs which patronise them. This trend is very dangerous and disruptive too.

  

Less said us better,more said is worst .  

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
