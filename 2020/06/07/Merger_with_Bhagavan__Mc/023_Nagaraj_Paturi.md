With regard to murder version, the issue is , it is demonizing a certain community in a way it is intended to have consequences for people belonging to that community.

  

When people dispute such versions , it is because of such consequences.

  

If your view is that I am not interested in such details, you are free not to be interested.

  

But if you are saying that please don't respond to demonizings and their consequences then there is the problem.
