Dear Dr Ravi Khangai,

  

The narrative of Tukaram's life is in the oral traditions of millions of Hindus. In none of these narratives, this version of murder is found. In most of the legends, Tukaram was taken to Vishnuloka while all the villagers were watching.

  

In Dehu there is the Vaikunthasthantemple at the spot from where Tukaram is believed to have ascended to Vaikunth.

  

Thousands of Varikaris visit Dehu and this spot as part of their Vari. This murder aspect is not there in the narratives held by Varikaris. Varikaris are predominantly nonbrahmins. Tukaram's followers including the Varikaris continue to hold his Bhakti based social reformational ideology. None of these have the version of murder in the narratives of Tukaram's life.

  

Even if, for the sake of argument, we agree that the Brahmins murdered Tukaram and hid that fact and allowed the version of ascendance to Vaikuntha float, what is the use of such an act when it does not serve the purpose of stopping the reverence for an ideology which is hypothesised as the motive behind the murder ?

  

Tukaram is believed to be a contemporary of Chatrapati Shivaji and is believed to be in very good relationship with him. Dehu is very close to Shivaji's fort / palace. An act of murder of a Bhakti saint in such circumstances is impossible to occur or if occurred , to get condoned by Shivaji so easily.

  

If the theory of murder is to be used for rationalizing supernatural versions of deaths, they can be created for any reformational Hindu spiritual leader. Such saintlyleaders are hundreds if not thousands in number.

  

There are one or the other rebel aspects in the lives of Sri Goda Devi and Sri Mira Bai also. Rationalizing the supernatural versions of their departures from the bhautika world can also be done through the version of murder by those who opposed the rebel aspects in their life or message.

  

------------------------------------

  

The discussion here is about the doctrinal explanation for the moksha version of the departures (from the physical world) of such spiritual legendaries, as per the school of thought held by those figures or their followers.
