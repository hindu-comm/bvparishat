Dear Shri Paturi Garu-->

  

You have encapsulated very well what many in this forum feel and have responded succinctly.

  

I am convinced it is because of such rabble rousers that Yogis seek out mountains, thick forests and cremation grounds to stay away from the hive mind of consensual reality.

  

Nothing is gained from debating with those of faux intellectualism, closed minds and prefixed sankalpa.

I think nowadays questioning the credentials of people like Tukaram has become fashionable in the name of "intellectualism" and if one can destroy the ubiquitous "evil Brahmin"..so much the better.

Two mangoes with one stone.

All this stems from the need for mediocrity to masquerade as "objectivity" and so the narratives are built on the basis of Occam's razor.

  

Disclaimer: None of the above of course applies to any of the people on this list or this thread, so there is no scope for taking umbrage.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
