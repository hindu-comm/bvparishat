It seems to be a political game,so that the young generation is carried away by these new views and miss the important point and indulge in caste politics which is beneficial to those political leaders in garnering votes .

  

I may point out that we get so many messages on whatsapp from the objective non brahmin thinkers who now praise the Brahmins for their selfless contributions in different fields and attack their own leaders who have been misleading them all these years.
