To bring back the discussion to the original topic,

  

the description of Sri Andal's 'merger' is as follows at Ramanuja.org<https://ramanuja.org/sv/alvars/andal/>

  

Andal blossomed into a beautiful young woman as she came of marriageable age. When asked to marry, however, she stubbornly refused, saying that she would only agree to marry Sri Ranganatha, the Lord at the great temple town of Srirangam. Vishnucitta despaired, wondering what was to become of his daughter. One night, Lord Ranganatha appeared in his dream and asked that Andal be sent to Him in all her wedding finery. Simultaneously, the Lord appeared before the priests at Srirangam and asked them to prepare for the coming of Andal. Vishnucitta once again was filled with both joy and sadness; joy that his beloved daughter would attain her goal,but sadnessat losing her at thesame time. He made all the wedding preparations and arranged for Andal's journey in a palanquin to Srirangam.

Andal waited with excited anticipation as the wedding party approached Lord Ranganatha's shrine. **As they entered the temple, she jumped out of the palanquin, unable to restrain herself any longer. Running into the temple sanctum, she embraced Lord Ranganatha and disappeared in a blaze of glory, having joined her Lord.** She was only fifteen at the time.

Andal is now one of the best loved poet-saints of the Tamils. Pious tradition reckons her to be the veritable descent of Bhumi Devi (Mother Earth) in bodily form to show humanity the way to His lotus feet. She is present in all Sri Vaishnava temples, in India and elsewhere, next to her Lord, as she always desired.

The question from Sri V Subrahmanian-ji is

  

Is there any study or record by authentic schools as to the state of these exemplary devotees*after*such merger as to whether their individual identity would remain distinct from that of Bhagavan? The question arises because in all Bhakti schools, the moksha is in a specific dhaama of Bhagavan and the distinction is admitted. In the stated cases there is no such going to that dhama but merger here, in this life itself, after which they are not believed to be seen here. Any inputs on this is welcome

I read that in Sri Vaishnavism where Sri Andal belongs, Jeevas are classified into Baddhas and Muktas.

  

The Muktas too have a process of getting liberated from Samsaara, raised to the divine status of Vaikuntha, where they get the new spiritual body of s'uddha sattva , being free from the load of Karma, their Dharmabuuta jnaananow attains to its maximum expansion and becomes one with Ishwara. But their Anutva remains distinguishing them from the Anantatva of Bhagavaan. In Vaikuntha they exist serving Bhagavaan, absorbed in the bliss of Brahman.

  

But I do not know if the explanation is different in the case of Sri Andal because she is viewed as the avataara of Bhudevi.
