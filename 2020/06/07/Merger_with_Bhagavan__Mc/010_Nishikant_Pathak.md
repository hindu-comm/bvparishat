Dear Mr. Ravi,

This imaginative theory of murder of Saint Tukaram Maharaj is false propaganda created by some scrupulous Anti-Brahmin organisations. They don't have any proofs on that.

  

If you visit Dehu, Gopalpura the place where from Saint Tukaram went to Vaikuntha loka, there is a tree named Nanduraki. On the day of Tukaram Beej every year, the day of Saint Tukaram Maharaj's departure to vaikuntha, the branches of tree moves even of there is no flow of air. Every Warkari witnesses this.

  

Morever, Saint Niloba who was disciple of Saint Tukaram had written a Shloka on Vaikuntha departure of Saint Tukaram.

  

Although Saint Tukaram had left to Vaikuntha Loka, he came 3 times and
gave darshan. Just after his departure, in a month's time when his daughter came to know about this incident, she reached to the place and did sankalp for darshan of Saint Tukaram. That time he gave his first darshan. Then again to Saint Niloba he gave darshan after Mulina left food n water for a month.

  

So regarding Saint Tukaram's vaikuntha gaman, there are some incidents that itselves stands clear that he left to Vaikuntha. Otherwise he would had narrated the stories of his murder to his daughter and his disciples.

  

So, we should not consider the false propaganda made by such anti-brahmin, anti-hindu organisations.

  

Regards,
