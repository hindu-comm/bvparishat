Do you want others not to believe ' Tukaram attained Moksha' ?

  

'Tukaram travelled to Vaikuntha' ?

  

I don't think you do.

  

Do you want others not to express their belief that ' Tukaram attained Moksha' ? 'Tukaram travelled to Vaikuntha' ?

  

I don't think you do.

  

Do you want others not to dispute between two versions 'murder' and ' no murder' ?

  

I don't think you do.

  

Do you object to those who side with 'no murder' to believe that ' X travelled to Vaikuntha' or ' X was taken to Vaikuntha' ?

  

I don't think you do.

  

Do those who side with 'no murder' to believe that ' X travelled to Vaikuntha' or ' X was taken to Vaikuntha' object to your view of 'Tukaram passed away' ?

  

They don't.

  

They agree with both your words 'passed' and 'away'.

  

How did he pass, to where did he pass are the details in which you are probably not interested. But they are.

  

Do you object to they being interested in such details?

  

I don't think you do.
