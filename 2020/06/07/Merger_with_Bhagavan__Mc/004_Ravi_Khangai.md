Dear Venkat Sir,

there is also a subaltern take on the disappearance of Tukarama. The Dalit narratives in the Maharashtra hypothise that Tukarama was murdered by the upper castes (Braahmins) and his body was disposed off. This was a reaction as he was very popular among the masses and challenged the exclusive privilegeof the Brahmins.
