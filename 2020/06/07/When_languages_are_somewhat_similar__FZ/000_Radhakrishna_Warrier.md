This happened decades ago. I was just out of college and had just joined India’s premier space organization in Gujarat, far from my hometown in Kerala.  

  

Not even a week had passed since I joined the organization when I went to the city center for personal errands. To return home,I had to catch a bus from a place called Lal Darwaja and get down at a place called Jodhpur Char Rasta near where I lived. I had been told that the bus number was 44 and it would be written like this: ૪૪. I found that bus, but to make doubly sure that it would go where I wanted, I asked the conductor in my textbook Hindi “क्या यह जोधपुर चार रस्ता जाएगी?” (Kya yeh Jodhpur Char Rasta jaayegi?). The conductor replied in Gujarati “ચઢી જાઓ પહેલવાન”. (Chadhee jaao pahelwan). With my textbook knowledge of Hindi, I decoded this message as “get in wrestler”. I was just a 22 year old young man, and was very pleased with this remark of the conductor. I looked like a wrestler with ripping muscles. Great. Next weekend, I had to do the same thing again - get in a bus from Lal Darwaja to Jodhpur Char Rasta. Asked the conductor the same question.
This time the conductor’s reply was slightly different. He said in Gujarati “ચઢી જાઓ મોટા”. (Chadhee jaao mota). Again, with my textbook Hindi, I decoded the message as “get in, fat one”. That was indeed a big blow to my self esteem. 😀. Did I look a fat man?

  

A couple more weeks had to pass before I came to know that “pahelwan” just meant gentleman in Gujarati, and not necessarily “wrestler”. Also, that mota was a term of respect, and not necessarily a fat man. 😀
