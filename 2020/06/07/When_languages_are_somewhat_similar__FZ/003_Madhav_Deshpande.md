The pronouns तू, तुम, and आप in Hindi are outwardly similar to तू, तुम्ही and आपण in Marathi. However, while आप is the common respectful form in Hindi, the common respectful form in Marathi is तुम्ही, while आपण in Marathi is somewhat reserved for very high almost ceremonial respect, rather than normal respect, in the Marathi usage of Pune familiar to me. But this difference between Hindi and Marathi sometimes creates misunderstandings. When I was in Fergusson College in NCC, some of our officers were from North India. My classmates used to refer to these officers respectfully with तुम, thinking this is like तुम्ही in Marathi, and the officers used to get very upset over this. It took some discussions between the parties to resolve the misunderstandings and for the Marathi students to learn to use आप.
