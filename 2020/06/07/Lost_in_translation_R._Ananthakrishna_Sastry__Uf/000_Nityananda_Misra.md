Dear vidvaj-janas

Please see the attached image. Above is Bhāskararāya’s commentary on the names ‘Manasvinī’ (930) and ‘Mānavatī’ (931) in the Lalitā-sahasranāma (TTD, Tirupati, 1985). Below is the translation of Bhāskararāya’s commentary into English by R. Ananthakrishna Sastry (The Theosophical Publishing House, Adyar, Madras, India, 1951).

The translation of the commentary on ‘Manasvinī’ is completely lost and the English translation states something totally diferent. Worse is the translation of the name as “intelligence” (‘Manasvinī’ is a feminine adjective, not an abstract noun). The translation of the commentary on ‘Mānavatī’ renders प्रियापराध incorrectly as “forgiveness of sin”.

Unless Sastry had a completely different reading of the commentary on ‘Manasvinī’ (even then translation of ‘Manasvinī’ as intelligence is erroneous) and a slightly different reading of the commentary on ‘Mānavatī’, the translation suffers from serious mistakes of commision and omission.

I have not read the full commentary by Sastry but I have directed people towards it in the past. Now I am afraid of doing so.

Thanks, Nityananda
