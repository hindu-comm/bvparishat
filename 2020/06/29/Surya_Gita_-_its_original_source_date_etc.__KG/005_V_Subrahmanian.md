Dear Shankara ji,

  

Thank you for the valuableinformation and the download links for the two works. My question arose by seeing the following in the Surya Gita:<https://sanskritdocuments.org/doc_giitaa/suuryagiitaa.html?lang=sa>

  

  

``` सगुणैकप्रधानैश्च विशिष्टाद्वैतवादिभिः । कैश्चिद्ब्रह्महरीशानामन्तर्यामित्वमुच्यते ॥ १६ ॥ ```

``` विशिष्टाद्वैतिनो वाऽन्ये सगुणैकाभिमानिनः । अशरीरानभिज्ञत्वान्मायापरवशा ध्रुवम् ॥ ३० ॥ ```

  

  

Upon opening the Rama Gita with Tattvasarayana contents, I found the following intriguing:

I raised the question aboutthe antiquity of the Surya Gita due to that term 'vishishtadvaitam', which we are familiar with Ramanuja's system.
Even there, they say, he had not used that term and it came to be called so by his followers, later. Thus, could the Surya Gita and the Tattvasarayana be works post-Ramauja? In the foreword it is indicated that the Tattvasarayana is extremely ancient.

In the Rama Gita is found the 108 Upanishads listed and the dialogue between Rama and Hanuman as is in the Muktikopanishad where the 108 Upanishads are listed.

  

Scholars may evaluate the Tattvasarayana and its various Gita-s in the light of the above and perhaps more observations. The name 'Gurujnana Vasishtham' resembles the Tamil name 'Jnana Vasishtham' for the popular Yoga Vasishtha in the Sri Ramana Maharshi circles.

  

warm regards

subbu
