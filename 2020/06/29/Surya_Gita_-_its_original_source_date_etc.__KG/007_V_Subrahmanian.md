Thanks Shankara ji for these links. I realized later that the 'vishishtadvaita' referred to in the Surya Gita verse is not representative of the Ramanuja school as the tenet stated there does not match that school. Maybe that term existed much earlier, as one might guess at this point of time when not much is known about the antiquity of the work.

  

warm regards
