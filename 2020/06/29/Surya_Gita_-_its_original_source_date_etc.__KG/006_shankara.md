Subbuji,

  

Sri. Jagannatha ji of BVP might be able to help you regarding the origin and antiquity of anubhavadvaita school. Jagannathaji has edited 'Gurusishyasamvada' of Appayasivachaya who was the propagator of anubhavadvaita in South India.

There is also a paper on 'Anubhavadvaita' by G. Krishna Sastri at the link given below. But, that too does not say anything about the antiquity of anubhavadvaita school.
