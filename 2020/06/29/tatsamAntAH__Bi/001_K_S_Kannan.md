Dear Ujjval-ji,

  

My focus was on consonant-ending words of Sanskrit (in the context of the comment on *anuShTubh*),

where in many cases the *prAtipadika* and the *prathamaikavacana* have different endings.

  

Further, **the emphasis was on the contrast** between how it is said in English

(as too in other non-Indian languages - perhaps - as I have not checked with all)

as against most Indian languages.

  

Typically, *upaniShad* in English, but *upanishattu* in **Kannada**.

Similarly, *vAkku, Rtvikku, Rkku*, etc.

Sometimes some more change is introduced, but mostly based on the *prathamAnta*,

as with *rAjanu, vidvAmsanu, hanumantanu, vaktAra, kartAra* &c.

(*Rce, tvace* etc. are also there).  

  

(BTW, your clubbing of words, introducing the bold with the first syllable of every next word

is undoubtedly a brilliant idea, but does not conduce to easy reading - for me at least).

  

Regards
