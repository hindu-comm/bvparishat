Namaste,

  

We know“एकीकरण” => “Ekikaran” transliteration is possible because IAST and other related map exists

  

If we want to do the reverse i.e“Ekikaran” => “एकीकरण” there is big challenges. Because we don't know how to translate“ra”=> र or र्, n=> न or न् or ण or ण् or ञ or ञ् or ङ or ङ्, ki=> कि or की or क्ि or क्ी or क् इ or क् ई

  

I am working on an AI project for sarcasm detection in Hinglish language. Many times people use Roman words in between and before I give it to a machine for model training I need to convert the Roman words written in the sentence to Devanagari script.

  

Are you aware of any open-source python library/package? That would be a great help.

  

Warm Regards

Hari Thapliyal
