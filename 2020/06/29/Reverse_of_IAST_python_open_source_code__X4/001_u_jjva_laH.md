This is no [IAST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration), to begin with.

  

The transliteration people generally do of words from Devanagari to Roman is not a well defined map (lot of cultural and personal variations), let alone it being an injective map. So, as has already been recognized, there is a lot of context-dependence to be dealt with in reverse transliteration. The only way it can be accomplished is through your AI. Just get lots of data and get going.

  

Wish you success in sarcasm detection.
