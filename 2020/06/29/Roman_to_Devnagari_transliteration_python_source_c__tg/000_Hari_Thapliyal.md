Namaste,

  

I am working on an AI project - Sarcasm Detection in Hinglish Language. Before I give content to a machine for training I need to convert that into Devanagari. However, sometimes words in sentences are written using the Roman script.

  

“एकीकरण” => “Ekikaran” is easy because of IAST map.  

  

but how to do“Ekikaran” => “एकीकरण” because “ra”=>रorर्, n=>नorन्orणorण्orञorञ्orङorङ्,
ki=>किorकीorक्िorक्ीorक् इorक् ई

  

I am looking for a python lib/package.

  

Warm Regards

Hari Thapliyal
