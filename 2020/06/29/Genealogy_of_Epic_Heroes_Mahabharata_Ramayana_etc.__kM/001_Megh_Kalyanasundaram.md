Hariom,

  

"full charts of genealogy of relations in Sanskrit literature": scope of that is, as I see, immense. I would be grateful if you could share bibliographic details of it if you get access to one. Thank you.

  

The following link is neither that of a book nor is it the genealogyof relations from all of Sanskrit literature but here is a recently (Apr 14, 2019) uploaded 394 seconds video titled *Lord Rama's Family Tree \| Genealogy of Surya Vansh \| Ramayana*<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_J8pCwvQJg>.

  

In the video, textual attestations for some of the names do show up (but not the full bibliographic data).

  

I have been meaning to work backwards from this video (to collate references with some bibliographic data) but haven't been able to do so

  

Sharing, though, if this helps.

  

Best,

Megh
