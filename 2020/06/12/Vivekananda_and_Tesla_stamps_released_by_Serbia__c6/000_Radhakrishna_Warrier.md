Vivekananda and Nikolai Tesla stamps released by Serbia:

India also released similar Vivekananda and Tesla stamps.

  

What caught my eye is that Serbia has printed the Vivekananda stamp in Latin script while the Tesla stamp is in Cyrillic script. 

  

This reminded me of what my Serbian friend and colleague Miroslav told me years ago. He said that Serbia uses both Latin and Cyrillic scripts somewhat equally. Of a newspaper, one page might be in Latin script and another page in Cyrillic. The language remains Serbian, only the script changes. People are proficient in both scripts.

  

Another colleague, a lady also from erstwhile Yugoslavia (forgot if she was from Serbia or Croatia) said about the usage of both Cyrillic and Latin for her language. But she seemed to be vehemently against the usage of Latin script. She said it was a relatively recent introduction. According to her, Cyrillic was best suited for her language and it was more "phonetic" than Latin.

  

This reminded me of the Gujarati school text books I saw decades ago. The gadya, the prose part was in Gujarati script. The padya, poems were in Devanagari script. Gujarati can be easily written in Devanagari script.
