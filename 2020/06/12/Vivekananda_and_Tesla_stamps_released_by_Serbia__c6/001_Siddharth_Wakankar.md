It will be revealation to many that this prectice of writing Gujarati in Devanagari Script was started by the Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad,III.

  

His main idea was: His subjects included Maharashtrian as well as Gujarati folks. So,he started this practice of printing in this way,so that both the communities maintain mutual respect for each other. Most of his official circulars were like this.
