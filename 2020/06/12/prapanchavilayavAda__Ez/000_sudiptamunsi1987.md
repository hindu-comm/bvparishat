Dear List Members,

  

Do you have any information about the identity of the proponent of prapañcavilayavāda as found in Brahmasūtrabhāṣya and Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣadbhāṣya of Śaṅkarācārya and as explicated by Sureśarācārya in his Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣadbhāṣyavārttika and Ānandagiri in his commentaries on the Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣadbhāṣya and Bṛhadāraṇyakopaniṣadbhāṣyavārttika? I have perused M. Hiriyanna's article on this as also Hajime Nakamura's short account of the theory in his masterly history of early Vedānta philosophy, but nowhere have I been able to find any mention of the name of the proponent of the said doctrine. Any input from your end will be highly appreciated and duly acknowledged in my upcoming paper.   

  

Sorry for cross-posting!

  

Thanks in advance!

  

Yours sincerely,

Sudipta Munsi
