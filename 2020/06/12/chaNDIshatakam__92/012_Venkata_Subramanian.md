Dear Sri.Shankara JI,

YOU are correct. Sri.Nagoji Bhatta is a commentator for DURGA SAPTHASHATHI AND NOT FOR CHANDI SHATHAKAMOF BANA BHATTA.

As of now only 2 sanskrit commentaries of Chandi Shatakamare available

The existence of Nagoji Bhatta commentary of Chandi Shatakamis not correct.

With kind regards.
