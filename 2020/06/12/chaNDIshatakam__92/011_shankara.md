Namaste,

  

I checked the references and found that this information is based on a misunderstanding by R. Krishnamacharya and subsequently by Amarnath Pandey.  

  

Amarnath Pandey on page 47 cites R. Krishnamacharya's 'History of Classical Sanskrit Literature', page 451 where Krishnamacharya cites the reference of 'Peterson's Detailed Report of Operations in Search of Sanskrit Manuscripts 1883, page 114.  

  

The manuscript described by Peterson on page 114 is not 'Chandi Sataka' of Banabhatta, but 'Chandistotra', most probably the famous Chandi or Durgasaptasati which has been commented upon by Nagoji Bhatta and Bhaskararaya.

  

Moreover, Peterson names the tika of Bhaksararaya as Guptavati, which coincides with name of the tika on Chandi aka Durgasaptasati by Bhaskararaya. Thus we can conclude that the information found in Amarnath Pandey's book is not factual. Screenshot from Peterson's report is given below.
