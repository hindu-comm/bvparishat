Respected scholars,

If anyone of you is aware about a PDF scan of the following work, or is willing to scan it afresh for me, I would appreciate it.

  

Trivandrum Sanskrit Series XLIII

Amarakosha with Amarakoshodghatana and Tikasarvasva.

  

I am aware about the following [archive.org](http://archive.org) file, but it is not amenable to OCRing.

  

A separate scan if any exists would be helpful.  

--  

Dr. Dhaval Patel, I.A.S

Collector and District Magistrate, Surat
