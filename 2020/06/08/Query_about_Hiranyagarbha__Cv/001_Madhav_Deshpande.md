Dear Professor Pandurangi,

  

  The word हिरण्यगर्भ: in Rigveda 10.121.1 is an अन्तोदात्त word, and this accent fits only a Tatpuruṣa compound, not a Bahuvrīhi where the first member retains its udātta accent. हिरण्मयस्य अण्डस्य गर्भभूत: प्रजापति: is the explanation offered by Sāyaṇa. He also offers a Bahuvrīhi interpretation: हिरण्मयोऽण्डो गर्भवद् यस्योदरे वर्तते.
However, the accent does not favor the Bahuvrīhi interpretation. With best regards,

  

Madhav M. Deshpande
