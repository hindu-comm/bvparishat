Sarvebhyo namah.

Hiranyagarbha is mentioned in Vedas Puranas etc. It seems it was actually a mound of gold. तदण्डमभवद्धैमं to quote manu.

It is narrated as the bija of all creation later.

  

What is the significance of it being gold.

How it reflects upon its parinama.  

How it is understood हिरण्यमेव

गर्भ इति वा हिरण्यं गर्भे

यस्य इति वा।

I request all scholars to help me.
