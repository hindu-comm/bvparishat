(not a scholarly reference, just my observation)  
I'd say it is the reference to a stage of the creation of Universe. In the initial stages of creation all of the Universe was dark, as there were no whole atoms to produce light. Only after it expanded enough, and cooled, the atoms were formed, and the light appeared. All of the Universe was ball or egg shaped, had no features because it was a blob of hot gas, and glowed orange, as a helium gas-discharge lamp.  
Although puruṣasūkta does not mention hiraṇyagarbha directly, it indicates the second wave of creation via virāj.  
Modern astronomy says it took some 380 000 years from initial creation to forming of atoms.  
There is a time reference in puruṣasūkta that I believe is worth further examination:  
yat puruṣeṇa haviṣā, devā yajñamatanvata, vasanto asyāsīdājyam, grīṣma idhmaś śarad dhaviḥ  
If each season is a year of the devā, the 3 seasons vasanto - grīṣma - śarad come quite near the 380 000 years.
