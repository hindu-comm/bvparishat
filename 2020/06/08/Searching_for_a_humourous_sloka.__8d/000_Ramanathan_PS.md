Vidvadbhyo namah.  
  
I had heard a humorous sloka during a spiritual upanyasa (discourse) which was in the form of a dialogue between the tongue and the teeth. It goes like this--  
  
Tongue to teeth: You are so awesome; you make the food so easy to process and palatable. How can I return this favour?  
  
Teeth: Please reduce your sharpness. I run the risk of getting knocked out as a result.  
  
I am not able to recall the entire sloka, as the audibility was poor.  
  
The beginning I do remember,  
  
जिह्वा वक्ति ... चूर्णीकृत्य  
  
and the last line ...  
  
तस्मात् प्रत्युपकारमत्र रसने पारुष्यहीनं वचः ।  
  
My efforts have failed and so am approaching you for your kind help in finding out its full version with a translation if possible.  
  
While searching the Subhasita-ratna-bhandagara, I could locate, another beautiful one on jihva.  
  
द्वात्रिंशद्दशनद्वेषिमद्ध्ये भ्रमसि नित्यशः ।  
तदिदं शिक्षितं केन जिह्वे संञ्चारकौशलम् ।।  
  
The following joke is on circulation in the internet --  
  
Teeth said to tongue: - If I just press you little hard, you will get cut.  
  
Tongue replied: - If I misuse one word against someone, then all the 32 of you will come out at...  
  
Warm regards,
