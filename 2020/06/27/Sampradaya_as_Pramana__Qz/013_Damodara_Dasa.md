Just to support this from Srimad Bhagavatam 10.33.31:  
  
īśvarāṇāṁ vacaḥ satyaṁ tathaivācaritaṁ kvacit  
teṣāṁ yat sva-vaco-yuktaṁ buddhimāṁs tat samācaret  
  
TRANSLATION  
The statements of the Lord’s empowered servants are always true, and  
the acts they perform are exemplary when consistent with those  
statements. Therefore one who is intelligent should carry out their  
instructions.
