Dear Shri Subrahmanian,

  

  Within the same passage, there is a further interesting statement:
यान्यस्माकं सुचरितानि तानि त्वयोपास्यानि । नो इतराणि ।, regards,

effectively requiring the students to use some judgment as to which behavior of the teachers they should and should not follow. They have to make sure they are following only the सुचरित of the teacher. Best,
