आचार हीनं न पुनन्ति वेदाः slokam

  

महाजनो येनगतस्ससपंथा ।

  

शिष्टाः प्रमाणम् ।

  

आचारवान् पुरुषो वेदः ।

  

There are so many instances like krishna saying dharmaraja to learn from BHEESHMA although he is capable to teach every thing.

  

Suka learning vedas although from birth he has those knowledge.

  

These types of several instances are there from which we can decide the sampradaya as a pramana one.
