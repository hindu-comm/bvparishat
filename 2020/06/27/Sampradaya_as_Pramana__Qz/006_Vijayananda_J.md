Namaste Nagaraj

I only meant whether SatSampradaya can be considered as a Pramana

What I meant by "source of Pramana" was if there were any references for such usage in any of the old works(other than established Pramana granthas), then, we might have to look for source for such usage

  

reason for asking this question

I was looking for whether, in some cases, if a sadachara, is not justified/backed by a pramana, then whether the very fact that it is being practised and has flown thro' the sampradaya - could be a pramana itself

(as an example - In MB, Yaksha Prashne, धर्मस्य तत्त्वं निहितं गुहायाम्महाजनो येन गतःसःपन्थाः )
