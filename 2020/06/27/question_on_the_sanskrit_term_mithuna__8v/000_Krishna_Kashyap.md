नमस्कार:

  

Is there any usage by anyone in Sanskrit (particularly from referenceable texts),

  

the term मिथुन

  

used in the sense of two aspects of the same entity. or referring to शक्ति and शक्तिमान्

  

I have seen it used in contexts like pair of birds or husband wife or something like that.
