Thanks a lot to Prof Korada Ji Megh,Kalyanasundaram Ji,Paturijifor all the help.

  

my simple questionis: when one states jAya bhumih PatirvyOma: here Pati means something else right? we cannot say patyurnAuyajna Samyoge. how does this relationship of pati patni be for some yajna of some sort? this relationbetween bhumi and vyoma should be of some other kind. Also mithuna does not seem to be like a husband wife mithuna at all.

  

I also did not understand: mithunam tA aruryatuh: what does this sentence mean?

  

Thanks.
