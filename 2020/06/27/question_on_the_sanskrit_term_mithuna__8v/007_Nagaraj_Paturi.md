In verses such as आहार निद्रा भय मैथुनंच सामान्यमेतत् पशुभिर्नराणाम् धर्मो हि तेषाम् अधिको विशेषो धर्मेण हीना: पशुभि: समाना:,

  

the taddhita form is specifically used in reference toconjugal relationship, more specifically to the act of sex, indicating that the original noun so modified also refers to those aspects only.
