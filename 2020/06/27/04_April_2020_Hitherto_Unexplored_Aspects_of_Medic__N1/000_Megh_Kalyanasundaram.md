**Abstract**

"Ayurveda is the traditional, ancient Indian system of health science. Vrikshayurveda is the ancient Indian science of plant life which deals with various trees and plant species and ensures the healthy growth and productivity. One of its chapters “Chitrikarana” depicts astounding techniques to make a plant bloom throughout the year irrespective of the season and other horticultural wonders to obtain different varieties of yield. The proper interpretation and availability of Vrikshayurveda can also play an important role in the field of intercropping and put forward for the use of organic fertilizers and can play a crucial role to build the ecofriendly environment. Kunapajala, a liquid biofertilizer explained in Vrikshayurveda is of great relevance in agriculture and horticulture. It can be prepared in a cost-effective way by using the raw materials like flesh and bone of animals, husk, oil cakes, dung, and urine of cattle which are easily available around us. The procedure of preparation is easy and economical too, which is an added advantage. A detailed study of Vrikshayurveda would also provide us with information on pest management based on the ecological principles. This paper intends to understand the traditional knowledge, particularly in the light of contemporary research, and demonstrate the value of traditional knowledge for cultivation and harvesting with special reference to medicinal plants. It is hoped that the ancient wisdom coupled with modern technology would benefit the mankind."
