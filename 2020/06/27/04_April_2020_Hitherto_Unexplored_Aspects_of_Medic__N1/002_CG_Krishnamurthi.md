Thanks for posting the link and abstract.

  

This is precisely my area of Research - "Vrikshayurveda for the cultivation of Medicinal plants".

  

The team here has looked at only one substance mentioned in one of the Vrikshayurveda text, that is "kuṇapajala" which is using fish meat (fermenting along with Cow dung). There are many other substances spread across many Vrikshayurveda texts for Soil management, Waterbody management, Seed preparation, Plant growth stimulation, pest control, storage management, etc.

  

I have referred to over 12 Vrikshayurveda texts and chapters among the 30+ works which I could find and list here<http://vriksha-ayurveda.blogspot.com/>

  

Regards

CG Krishnamurthi
