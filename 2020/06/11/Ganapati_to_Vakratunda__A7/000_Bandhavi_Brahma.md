Pranam to all scholars,

  

I have read that in the early times, the names Ganesha and Ganapati applied for Indra, like in आ तू न इन्द्र RgvedaGanesha suktam. But when names like Vakratunda and Ekadanta appear for example in Ganapati Atharvashirsha mantra, it becomes more tailored for Ganesha in the ParvatiputraVinayaka form with elephant head. I read that western indologists consider Ganapati Atharvashirsha to be late origin from even 16th century CE. How is it still having udattadi svaras in such a case? Does Shri Adi Shankaracharya mentions Ganapatya tradition in his works?

  

My question is are there any known works or commentaries tracing a connection between vedic devata like Indra and modern form of Ganapati? Are names like Vakratunda or Ekadanta applied for any vedic devata directly, in any purana or tantras? Please direct me to works on Ganapatya which explore its connections with veda, similar to other works which do the same for Shaiva and Vaishnava.

  

Thanks to all in advance and namaskar,

Bandhavi
