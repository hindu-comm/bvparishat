Sir, such 'vinayaka-s' in plural is there in the Srimadbhagavatam too, one instance is where post-Putana death, the gopi-s did a 'purification' ritual to the baby Krishna (owing to the physical contact with Putana), where they chant - 'let the vinayaka-s go away'. 

  

From this we conclude that these vinayaka-s are evil spirits. The benign Vinayaka for which the method of puja, even the modaka, etc. are stated in the Yajnavalkya Smriti.

  

Also, the Mahabharata is believed by many to have been scribed by Ganesha, the elephant-faced god. Madhvas hold this belief. In the Villi Bharatam, by a Tamil (stated to be Ramanuja school), also includes this in his work. Also Madhvacharya has given a place for Ganesha in his Mandukya Upanishad Bhashya, as a presiding deity in one of the three states (of waking, etc.). This is my understanding.

  

1. Balakanda, sarga 22, verse 11:

As they followed sage Viswamitra spreading radiance, they looked like sons of the god of fire, (Skanda and Visakhu) following the incomprehensible Siva.

Not sure why two sons of Shiva are admitted and how the other is not Ganesha. If any further information is available on the identity of the 'other', welcome. Why is it that the above two are not popular in parlance?
