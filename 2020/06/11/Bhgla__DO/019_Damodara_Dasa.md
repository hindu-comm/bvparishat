Hare Krishna.

  

As I told yesterday, here are the quotes from Vallabhacarya and VijayadhvajaTirtha which say that bhugola refers to flat bhumandala:

  

SB 10.8.37, Vijayadhvaja tirtha:  
bhUgolaM bhUmaNDalaM\|  
"Bhugola means bhu-maNDala (gola taken as mandala is translated as circle also in Monier Villiams)"  
Vallabhacarya's Subodhini tika:  
adrayo mervAdayo dvIpA jambudvIpAdayo abdhayo lavaNAdaya etaiH sahitaM bhUgolaM\|  
"Bhugola involves mountains like meru, islands like jambudvipa, and oceans like saltwater ocean."  
  
SB 2.7.1, vallabhacarya, subodhini (Prthivi by prathana on lotus leaf, source from sruti)

For actual sourceand contextual reference just go to the Bhagavata Commentaries document on Archive website and go to particular verse under discussion.
