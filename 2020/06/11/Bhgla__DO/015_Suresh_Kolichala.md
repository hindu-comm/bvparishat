Dear Radhakrishna,

  

As far as I know, in Puranic cosmology, the lower-seven lokas and the upper seven-lokas are described to be in the shape of a disc (plate-like shape), as shown below.

Āryabhaṭa definitely described earth as spherical and even speculated it to be rotating on its own axis, but did not propose earth's rotation around the sun. Although the idea of earth's rotation is fully rejected by later Indian astronomers, his claims for sphericity lingered on. Brahmagupta earlier and Bhāskara later are known to have criticized Puranas for their view that earth is flat like a disc and supported byŚeṣu.  
  
But the concept of spherical shape of earth appears to be a common knowledge shared among the philosophers and astronomers of those times from Greek to India to China (some trace back this idea to earlier Phoenician sailors). There is a vast amount of literature on the history of spherical Earth. Many are available on Google books, if you look up.
