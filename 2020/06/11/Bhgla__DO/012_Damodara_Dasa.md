Hare Krishna.  
  
Dear Visvasji,  
Pranams  

  
\>\> Interesting - but still no closer to an answer to my question. A (very literalist) mAdhva I know thinks that earth is a spheroid placed on a plane and that circum-polar satellite orbits are impossible.  
  

My point was that merely collecting the word bhugolaka may not solve  
the problem by saying that sastras say earth is golaka (sphere)  
because here is the meaning of bhugolaka interpreted as golaka  
refering to the sphere of universe and bhu refering the the plane  
bhumandala of that anda-golaka (universe).  
  
I have been thinking in this aspect for many years now. This  
particular idea that the earth (on which we live) is a spheroid and is  
placed on a plane, seems to some difficulties: For instance, according  
to puranic descriptions (if taken literally) the bhumandala is a plane  
and if spheroid earth is kept on that plane then in one of the  
hemispheres (after about cancer or capricorn tropic) you cannot  
directly see the stars. Also uttarayana and daksinayana positions of  
sun cannot be satisfactorily explained. (that doesn't mean I say that  
in flat earth theory we can explain them satisfactorily). If you can  
throw some light on this it would be instructive.  

  
\>\> To add another question: Does your tradition insist that the "flat earth" model reflects reality better?  
  

In case of our tradition (Gaudiya Vaisnavism) this particular issue  
doesn't seem to be discussed in very detail as far as I know (besides  
some commentaries to the 5th canto of Srimad Bhagavatam. Some Gaudiya  
Vaisnava scholars in this forum can correct me and give some more  
information.  
  
Whatever is discussed from 5th canto commentaries (and the text  
itself) it seems that flat earth theory is supported, specifically if  
you see the calculations they have made (as is evident in the above  
quote I have sent where lokaloka mountain's position is determined and  
the aggregate of all the islands on bhumandala has been calculated to  
almost touch the layers of our Universe).  
  
I did visit your github website and had a small look on all the  
material you have gathered there (when time permits I would like to  
study whatever you have gathered there). You have quoted one paper  
from Sadaputa Dasa who was a scientist and ISKCON devotee (disciple of  
His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada). In that paper  
he argues for the spheroid earth theory and synchronizes the  
calculations mentioned in the puranas with the modern calculation we  
have with our observations. Thus, he proposes four types of  
interpretations of the puranic texts for them to match with visible  
reality in the matter of the Universe. However, for your information,  
this theory had already been challenged by other ISKCON members and  
doesn't stand at its full now.  
One of the arguments is that in his theory he dismantles the idea of  
existence of plane bhumandala and reduces them to the imaginary  
description of the planetary orbits when seen from the geocentric  
reference. The data does match to about 65% accuracy. However, then we  
have to give up the idea of bhumandala. But we find in all scriptures  
direct description of existence of three kinds of svargas -- 1.  
Svarga, 2. Bhauma-svarga (different islands on bhumandala plane) and  
3. Bila-svarga (atala, vitala, etc.).  
  
There are many more arguments to all his four interpretations of  
puranas and thus it will be too big a leap of interpretation when  
direct (abhidha) is possible.  
  
My view at this point:  
===============  
\* Whenever description of Universe starts in puranas etc. it is always  
mentioned that comprehending it is not possible for humans. Even yogis  
do not see it fully or comprehend it what they are seeing.  
\* It is our understanding that pratyaksa and anumana pramanas have  
their limitations and are not to suprecede sabda pramana.  
\* Thus, I accept what is said in sastras as true and adjust my  
understanding according to that.  
\* For instance, it is mentioned that Mount Meru is seen as having  
different number of corners when seen by different yogis depending on  
their realizations. Even colors of this mountain vary. For humans,  
they are not even able to see it due to insufficient punyas  
\* Also, in case of Sisumara-cakra, only the yogis who have realized  
can see the svarga-loka as body of sisumara.  
  
Much could be discussed but I think here I can stop; this much should  
be sufficient for you to know my current stance. I would like to  
discuss and share much in this regard as it has always been a subject  
of my interest from my childhood.  
  
Thankyou,  
Hari Guru Vaisnava das,
