Thanks, Dr Bhat. I think this Geeta kind of currency as different from use in Astronomical texts is what Sri Radhakrishna Warrier is looking for.

  

In classical literary works of regional literatures too we find such expressions attesting the knowledge of circularity, (valaya, chakra) etc. rotating , sphericality (gola ) etc.

  

Even when they talk of three lokas, if they talk in terms of their rotation that includes the rotation of the Earth.
