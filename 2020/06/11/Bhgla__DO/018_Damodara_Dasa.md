Just for clarification I tried to create a diagram (though crude). Please see it pasted below here:

What I understand what Visvanatha Cakravarti Thakura wants to say is that when the word bhu-golaka is mentioned it is referring to the hemisphere in which bhu-mandala (the brown plate as shown above in which 7 islands are there) exists and that because bhumandala is also placed very much in the center of Universe (see the center plane divining it vertically in two halves), the diameter of bhu-gola is also same as that of khagola (which can be taken either as the whole sphere or the upper hemisphere, both way the diameter is the same). Khagola and anda-golaka are different as seen in the diagram.
