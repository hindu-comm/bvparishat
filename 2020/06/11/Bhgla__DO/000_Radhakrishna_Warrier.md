Has the word bhūgōla been used in Sanskrit or any Indic languages in premodern times in the sense of the world, the earth etc.? In Malayalam, bhūgōḷam is quite frequently used in the above sense.
However, I am not sure if it is a premodern word or a modern word coined after the English word “globe” used in the sense of the world, the earth etc.

If it is a premodern word, it would mean that even non-scientific people like poets, storytellers etc., knew that the shape of the earth is that of a globe, or in other words, that the earth is round. Of course, astronomers and scientists like Aryabhata, Brahmagupta and Bhaskara very well knew that the earth is round, that it rotates on its axis and that it revolves round the sun. They knew much more as can be seen from their astronomical works.
