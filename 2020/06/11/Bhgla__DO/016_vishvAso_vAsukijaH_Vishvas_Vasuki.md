The non-heliocentricism bit seems to be an uncharitable misreading:

\- In the words of Thurston: "Not only did Aryabhaṭa believe that the earth rotates, but there are glimmerings in his system (and other similar Indian systems) of a possible underlying theory in which the earth (and the planets) orbits the sun, rather than the sun orbiting the earth. The evidence is that the basic planetary periods are relative to the sun. For the outer planets this is not significant: both earth and sun are inside their orbits and so the time taken to go round the earth and the time taken to go round the sun are the same. The significant evidence comes from the inner planets: the period of the śīghrocca is the time taken by the planet to orbit the sun."  
- S Kak - "The śīghrocca maps the motion of the planet around the sun to the corresponding set of points around the earth. This indicates a tradition of heliocentric astronomy as applied to the solar system. The sun, with its winds that hold the solar system together, is, in turn, taken to go around the earth."

This too is incorrect. Aryabhata's ideas were rejected by some (brahmagupta, varAhamihira), fully accepted by others (pRthUdakasvAmI, makkibhaTTa, bhaTTatiri).
