Hare Krishna.

  

Please find the attached file which contains the excerpt in context. I have extracted allcommentariesfrom sloka no.25 till 40.

Please read the sanskrit carefully. The purpose of this paragraph is to summarize the calculations already mentioned in before section till now in order to fix the position of lokaloka mountain. As far as I understand from sanskrit it says:  

  

"That (sa) refers to lokaloka mountain; bhugolakasyameans (measurement) related bhu of anda-golaka (spherical universe). Like the (orbit of) sun is in the center of anda-golaka (universe) similarly the earthly system (bhuvah) is also situated in the center of the universe, and thus measurement (diameter) of bhu-golam is also 50,00,000 yojanas same as that of the kha-golam (the sphere of space)."

  

I think here it is made clear that bhu-golaka is not something sphere, that universe is a sphere, and that kha-golam is the sphere of space (kham) which is obviousbecause the sky element in the center is of 50,00,00,000 yojana diameter which is surrounded by the earth matter layer, and then the total of 6 more concentric layers surround. If you read this full then you will find that Srila Visvanatha Cakravarti Acharya makes the point that the bhumandala should (in diameter) measure a little less than the diameter of the khagola otherwise the bhumandala plate will touch the first layer and then it will not be possible for it to fall down in garbhodaka water and thus Lord Varaha lila cannot happen. If he would have meant that the earthly system is sphere then with 50,00,00,000 yojanas diameter it will not leave any space for any of the svarga planets or for that matter even the garbhodaka sagara.

The author has written a book in this matter named "The Mystic Universe." Also there is a video to this effect which, if I find out, I will post the link here. Therein he shows his calculations and mentions how much accurately they comply with the real data.

Yes. You can read Bhagavata canto 5. Some of this is mentioned there. Sukadeva Gosvami poists this.

You can look at description of Mount Sumeru.



Tomorrow I will find out one quote from Vallabhacarya's commentary to Bhagavata wherein he says that Earth is made by Lord Brahma by flattening the soil on Lotus Petal and because this procedure is called prathana, earth is called Pruthvi.

  

Prathana is something like making thick chapatis by hand.
