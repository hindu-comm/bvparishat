Dear all,

Namaste.

  

Greetings from Team Samsaadhanii!

  

Many of you might be aware that theDepartment of Sanskrit Studies and its alumni, University of Hyderabad is organising an "International Webinar Series - Introduction to Samsaadhanii" from 16 May 2020. We completed the first phase of the series with five lectures by seven scholars on different topics ranging from simple Sandhi tool to domain-specific Nyaya tool. We introduced the Sanskrit Computational Linguistics (SCL) tools developed by Prof Amba Kulkarni and her students.Recordings of all these events are available at <https://www.facebook.com/groups/uohsanskritstudies/videos>.The proceedings of the webinar were in the mixture of English, Hindi and Sanskrit.

  

Currently, we are planning for the second phase to explain how the insights from the shastras were helpful in developing these online computational tools. You may join our Google groups (<https://bit.ly/scl-group>) for more information about the future events.

  

These are the links for the SCL tools -<http://scl.samsaadhanii.in/scl/>and <http://sanskrit.uohyd.ac.in/scl/>

  

Based on the feedback of the participants, we are planning to organise the webinar series in many Indian languages. We request interested candidates to fill this form -<https://forms.gle/nyhiCjXZRGmWp8b28>.

Thank you!

  

Regards,

Dr Arjuna
