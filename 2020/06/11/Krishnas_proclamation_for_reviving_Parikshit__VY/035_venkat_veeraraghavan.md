Shri Aditya ji:

  

Actually dharma is not a law although it has been codified as such in the dharmashastras.

It is an ever evolving understanding of the most wise course of action within a given context.

Dharma is basically a guide for karma. Again karma is based on one's personal capacity.

So Dharma and Karma basically feed off each other. Appropriate Karma leads to chittashuddhiwhich in turn throws more light on dharma which modifies karma further and thus the feedback loop goes.

  

Dharma is extremely subtle which is why even Mahapurushas like Bhishma referred Draupadi back to Dharmaraja on the question of Dharma in the Kuru-rajyasabha.

And please remember hindsight is always 20-20.

  

And Krishna's application was not practical in any sense of the term.

There is a difference in Ram-lilaand Krishna-lila in the way they act.

In every act of Rama the limitations a man is exhibited, while in Krishna Ishatvamdrips in even the most mundane of acts. His actions cannot be imitated even if one knows what is to be done.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
