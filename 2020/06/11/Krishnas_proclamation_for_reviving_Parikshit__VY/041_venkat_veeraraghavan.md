Dear Shri Aditya ji,

  

Law/Neeti (Maybe) is Outside in

  

Dharma (Inside out)----read the section on svadharma etc in BG

  

There lies the difference.

What Draupadi did no other woman can profitably imitate.

  

When Kunti later laments to Vyasa about doing prayaschitta for her renouncing Karna as a child, Vyasa replies that for those with great personal power (like Kunti) the paribhasha of dharma changes. (I cannot find the exact source now).

  

What Bhishmadid no one else can imitate or take as pramana.

  

Yudhisthira in disgust asked Arjuna to give away the Gandiva to someone elsewho can kill Karna if he was not competent to do so.

Arjuna had sworn an oath to kill anyone who would ask him to give his gandiva away (effectively asking him to give up kshatriyadharma).

This is another manifestation of dharma in different directions.

Arjuna was focussed on protecting his dependents and hence took such a vow.

  

Karna on the other hand was concerned about his reputation as a daanveer and this pride leads to his own downfall. He hacks off the basis of his own strength (which is against kshatriya dharma as per definition of dharma) when he cuts off his armour and ear ringsfor Indra.

A brahmana is respected for jnana, a kshatriya for strength, a vaishya for wealth and a shudra for years (of service). This is a manifestation of each varna's dharma, for respect is always given for walking on the path of dharma.

What Krishna did was satisfying the letter of dharma while avoiding the unnecessary consequences for Arjuna and Yudhisthira.  

Insulting a superior is equal to killing the person.

Self-praise is akin to killing oneself.

  

Dharma should be something doable (for the subject). This is why there is what we call aapad-dharma what we should do when faced with difficulty. Ex: when one is sick one cannot do a full sandhyavandana etc one does important stuff like arghya pradana and basic minimum japa.

  

This is where adhikara (capacity to practise dharma) enters into the equation.

What Draupadi, Arjuna, Krishna did was based on their personal capacity.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
