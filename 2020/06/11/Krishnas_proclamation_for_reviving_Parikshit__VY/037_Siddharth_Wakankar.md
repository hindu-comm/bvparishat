Dear Venkat ji,

  

Very subtle differences are brilliantly brought out by your good self. Am glad to get your valuable feedback on Yuddhadharma which does undergo changes according to the situations and times .

  

I am reminded of a statement of the great Sayanacharya,viz. युगांतरद्रष्टव्य: अयं धर्म:.

  

Your posts are always refreshingly enlightening and enjoyable too because of the depth of your knowledge in various subjects and shastra.

  

Do continue to guide people like me/ us with your sll round scholarship and genius.

  

Warm regards and thanks.

  
  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
