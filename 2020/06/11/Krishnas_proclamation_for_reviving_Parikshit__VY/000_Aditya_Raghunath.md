Dear All,

  

In the Mahabharatha, Krishna revives Parikshit by stating the following truths

  

1. He never lied in his life even for the purpose of amusement  

  

2\. He never turned back from any battle

3\. Dharma and Brahmins are dear to him

4\. He never had a misunderstanding with Arjuna

5\. Truth and righteousness are always established in him

6\. Kansa and demon horse Kesi has been righteously slain by him and the dead child of Uttara should revive by that truth.

My question is what is so special about these truths. For ex:

\* Instead of (4) above, he could have mentioned that he never had fight with Balarama,

\* What is special about (3), all great sages and saints say that

\* Instead of (6) he could have said, i killed Pootana/Shishupala or so many other demons.

Also, most of these statements could have been made by Yudhishtara/Veda Vyasa/Vidura/Bheeshma?

Any thoughts would be appreciated

Pranaams

Aditya
