Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

I consider this question interesting is due to the circumstances during which this proclamation was done by Krishna. When no other person(including Rishis like Vedavyas, Shuka) could take up the challenge to save Parikshit from Brahmastra, Krishna makes these statements and saves Parikshit. Some of these statements don't appear to be anything special, which only Krishna could have said/done.

  

There is a somewhat parallel in Ramayana, when Lakshmana kills Indrajit by taking oath on Rama's virtues.

  

Regards

Aditya
