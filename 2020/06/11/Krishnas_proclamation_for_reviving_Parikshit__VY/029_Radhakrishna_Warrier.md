Lord Krishna avoided a battle (raṇa) with Jarāsandha by leaving Mathura with its entire Yadava population and settling in Dwaraka.  This is what I have heard and I think this story is the basis for the Gujarati name Ranchhod. Actually, this was not an act of running away from battle, but a tactical avoidance of battle, in my view.
