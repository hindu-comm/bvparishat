Shri Siddhartha ji...

  

You are making me faint with shame with words that i do not deserve.

  

I am not knowledgeable of even language what to speak of shastra?

  

Whatever little comes out is due to osmosis from various MM, scholars and professors here in BVP who generously share their knowledge.

  

I post my thoughts mostly hoping to be corrected if I am wrong.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
