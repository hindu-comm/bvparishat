Very well stated.

  

The last *pAda* speaks of a relatively safe path.

But it is the third *pAda* that brings out the truth

\- of the subtlety of the issue: the inscrutability of dharma by easy/simple methods.

  

The general limit(ations)s of \[non-specialised\] logic are stated first,

and the multiplicity of vantage points and parameters are implied by the rest.

  

In this context, the singular role assigned to AnvIkShikI by Kautalya

ought not to be forgotten, and its utter compatibility with his own assertion:  

*trayyA hi rakShito lokaH prasIdati na sIdati.*
