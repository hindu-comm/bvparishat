ShriSiddharth ji:  

  

You are right it can be summarised as "Yuddhadharma".

  

However these days "dharma" is conflated with "religion" , "ethics" etc it is necessary to think about things from a first principles perspective to avoid confusion.

Also the interpretation of yuddhadharmaand the attendant karma would have a different manifestation for say Arjuna or some other person.

Krishna of course brings His own unique perspective and way of viewing and handling things.

For ex: In the Jayadratha vadha parva Arjuna's response to Yuddhadharma
would not have included "obscuring the Sun '' to get past 6 Maharathis standing between him and Jayadratha.

  

As Schopenhauer put it "Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."

This might have been inspired by a reading of LakshmanA's svayamvara where the target was hidden on all sides that only Krishna among an illustrious list that included Arjuna was able to pierce.

  

One's actions are constrained by one's understanding of prakrti and kAla. Only one who has transcended both can show mastery in action. Whether it is the episode of Krishna refusing to enter a needless fight with Kalayavana or fleeing Jarasandha'sforces to Gomanta shows a focus on what is necessary for dharma rather than what is necessary for yashas.

If you notice the lives of Karna and Krishna you will see many similarities in the way they were born away from their biological family, how they both reacted to their contexts. Karna chose fame and imperial prestige, while Krishna chose dharma.

Krishna did not go out of His way to seek any fights. Keshi and Kamsa were both thrust on Him.

Dharma is defined as that which bears.

So in a sense violation of dharma is foolishness and adharmis are routinely called fools by the Knowers like Vidura. An adharmi is somewhat similar to a Kalidasa who cuts off the branch of the tree while being seated on the "unsafe" end. Ayurveda has a word for this "prajnAparAdha".

  

For a Kshatriya a horse/ashva holds the same position as the Homa Cow holds for a Brahmana in the sense that the ashva is a support for the execution of his dharma.

Slaying a horse except in the context of Yajna (whether ashvamedha or in war) was considered sinful.

The same can be said of regicide especially since after rajyabhishekhaa King is considered an aspect of Vishnu. If I am not wrong the consort of a King is considered one of the eight mothers along with the cow.

Rarely has a King been killed by his own subjects despite systematic cruelty.

  

So in this context a justification behind the slaughter of Keshi and Kamsa is required in the perspective of dharma. Was there a wrong motivation behind the act? Agni as karmasakshi acts as the witness in this regard and intermediates between the invoker and the astra.

  

Kind Regards,

  

Venkat
