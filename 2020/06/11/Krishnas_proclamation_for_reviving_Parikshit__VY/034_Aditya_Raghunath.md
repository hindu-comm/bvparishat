Shri Venkatji.

Very nicely you have mentioned how Krishna's perspective on dharma was different and more practical than those of others. I think if Bheeshma and Drona had the same understanding as Krishna's, of dharma then the whole episode of game of dice and subsequent dis-robing of Draupadi wouldn't have happened. There is a big difference between knowing the law and applying it correctly.

  

Regards

Aditya
