Dear Shri Siddharthji ,

  

Swearing on mother is pretty common across India not just MH.

As in "maa kasam", all the way uptothe ultimate "mother promise" of a third grader showing that he is not horsing around.

  

Shri Murthy ji:

  

Swearing on a limb not so much but to swear on someone's feet shows respect. The relationship of a Bhakta is symbolic and represented by Bhagavan's feet. Even today saints are called Bhagavatpada, Prabhupada etc. It effectively translates to I swear by my bhakti for you which implies seriousness.
