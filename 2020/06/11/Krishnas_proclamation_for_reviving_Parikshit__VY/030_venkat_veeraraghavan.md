Dear Shri Aditya ji--  

  

I am well aware of the raN-chod raai moniker for Thakur.

This is an example of nindaa-stuti and not to be taken literally.

  

Expression whether in language or action is to be analysed from intention to manifestation.

  

If it is vAk it starts from parA and ends in vaikhari.

If it is action, it starts from sankalpa and ends in karma.

  

Sri Krishna's sankalpa was to uphold dharma by killing Kalayavana while keeping Shiva's boon to Garga intact.

"satyam vidhatum nijabhrtyabhashitam..."

Since a Yadava could not kill Kalayavana, Krishna appeared out of the fortress of Mathura and walked unarmed while Kalayavana gave chase trying to catch Him.

Now Krishna's sankalpa was to be a nimitta to make Kalayavana meet up with Muchukunda in the cave where he was staying.

To this end, He led Kalayavana on and put His piitambharaon the sleeping Muchukunda.

Mistaking the sleeping form to be Krishna, Kalayavana kicked him and was reduced to ashes when Muchukunda woke up and opened his eyes.

  

How does this qualify as raNchod?

The sankalpa was fulfilled wasn't it?

The lakshana of a kshatriya is to protect the innocent/weak.

kshatAt trAyate iti kshatriyaH

  

A true kshatriya is one who takes a sankalpa and either he achieves the sankalpa or he perishes in attempting to fulfill it. It's Do or Die in attempting to Do. There is no third option.

The moniker raNchod would have validity if Krishna had faced Kalayavana and run away being unable to handle him. He never even entered into combat and instead led him to his death.

There is kartum, akartum and anyatAkartum....this is the field of anyathAkartum.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
