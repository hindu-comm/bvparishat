Dear Shri Venkatji,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts. Law is also supposed to evolve over time and is also subject to change as per the different social norms prevailing in the times. As you mentioned, Dharma is the most wise course of action defined for the particular context. With these definitions both dharma and law seem similar.

  

There was this instance in Mahabharata, where Arjuna wants to kill Yudhishtira for insulting his bow, but Krishna provides a very unique interpretation of killing and instead asks Arjuna to insult his brother. There are quite a few instances in the war where Krishna's interpretation of dharma saved Pandavas. In that sense it was more practical, while others were still looking for answers.

  

Regards

Aditya
