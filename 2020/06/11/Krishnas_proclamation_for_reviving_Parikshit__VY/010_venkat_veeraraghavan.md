Dear Dr. Kannan,

  

Sir some have the following version:

धर्मात्मा सत्यसन्धश्च रामो दाशरथिर्यदि \|\| ९०-६-७१ पौरुषे चाप्रतिद्वन्द्वस्तदेनं जहि रावणिम् \|  

  

Is this a difference between various texts?

  

The interesting parallels are that in both instances the ones doing the invocation are speaking to astras who are considered embodied beings that were created by Svayambhu for protecting dharma.

Hence they are elemental forces that form the substratum of what we consider as dharma.

Sita addresses Agni

Since satya is the basis of dharma that might be a reason for such invocations.

  

Interestingly Gandhari invokes her merit of पति शुश्रूषा in order to curse Sri Krishna at the end of the MB war.

  

Shri Aditya ji:

  

While what Dr. Kannan says is valid in the sense invoking something else can draw the same question, there might be specific reasons for these being selected:

  

In the episode of Arjuna performing tapasya for pashupatastra, Shiva beats Arjuna to within an inch of his life. Throughout the fight Arjuna uses normal arrows and avoids maantric weapons assuming the kairata is not a dvija and hence may not have access to celestial weaponry.

This will not make sense unless one realises the reason for this beating was to test Arjuna's patience and adherence to truth in the face of abject humiliation and destruction.

It is such moral fibre that later enabled him to withdraw the Brahmashira after employing it to counter Ashvatthama's weapon.

  

Unfortunately this episode is butchered by modern retellings of the epic on TV .

  

As a counterpoint, Arjuna does not waste time using normal arrows against the Gandharva Chitraratha and employs the agneyastra on him because he knew his adversary was supernatural.

  

The point being the Astras are sentient weaponry who lose potency when misused.

It was precisely for this reason that Drona's weapons lost strength on the day of his death; because he used celestial missiles against common soldiers.

The deities presiding over the weapons also speak to the one doing the invoking and prevent him from releasing an arrow if death by the arrow is certain but the target's time has not come yet. (as in Pradyumna against the Lord of Saubha)

  

There are not many intimate details on how exactly Keshi and Kamsa were killed but I suspect mantras were used and Krishna was justifying the same given the supernatural origins of His adversaries. I dont see any rationale for invoking them specifically because Krishna's kill-count is rather extensive to say the least!



The purpose of the Brahmastra is to protect dharma (as a last resort) and hence the invocation of Dharma, Brahmins, Satya. etc.

Now Why Arjuna and not Balarama?

1\. Balarama and Krishna did have a misunderstanding in the episode of the Syamantaka mani. Balarama suspected that his brother had appropriated the gem for himself when in truth Akrura had it.  
2. Parikshit is Arjuna's grandson and it is only logical that Krishna invoke His relationship with the man whose lineage was about to be destroyed.

  

Regards,

  

Venkat
