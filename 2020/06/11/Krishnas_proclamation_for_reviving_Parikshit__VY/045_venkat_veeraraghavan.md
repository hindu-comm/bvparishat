Dr. Kannan and Dr. Bhat have put it very aptly.

Dr. Kannan has beautifully interwoven Ayurveda chikitsa with application of dharma.

  

The intricacies of dharma are very hard to judge.

It is relatively easy for us with past, present and future laid out to judge right from wrong based on Vyasa's text.

  

It is MUCH MUCH harder to judge in real time.

  

Which is why Dharmaraja occupies pride of place even amongst the illustrious in theKuru-raajsabha.

  

If the likes of Bhishma and Vidura should refer Draupadi to Dharmaraja for clarification, it is not upto the rest of us to stand on judgement.

  

Shri Aditya ji: Dharma is not what is practical if you conisder the way practical is defined in the current epoch. But yes you are right in the sense Dharma is what can be practised wrt desha, kala, svabhava and current state as a function of all previous karma.
