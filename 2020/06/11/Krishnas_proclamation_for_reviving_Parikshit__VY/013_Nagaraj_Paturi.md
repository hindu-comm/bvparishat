Here शापितः is used in the sense of 'swear on'.

  

**swear**on (someone or something)  
To make a very serious, solemn pledge or oath, especially that one is telling the truth. The person or thing following "on" is typically someone or something that one loves or respects.

  

I guess the closest translation could go as

  

"Swear on my feet my dear (younger one)! Don't go (from here) for long. /for ever/at all."

  

The commentator is explaining why Sri Rama mentions his own feet. Govindaraja is saying that Sri Rama mentions his own feet because he knows that Lakshmana respects him. If Lakshmana himself would have sworn, he would have said, " I swear on your feet , I shall not go (from here) for ever/at all.

  

on is the preposition (vibhakti/case marker) that is idiomatic for English. Triteeyaa is idiomatic for Sanskrit.
