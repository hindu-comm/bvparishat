Apart from involvements of the divine element in certain special circumstances,

such "swearings" are not impossible even in "mundane" situations,

as in प्रतिज्ञा-यौगन्धरायण of Bhasa :

यदि तां चैव तां चैव तां चैवायत-लोचनाम् ।

नाहरामि नृपं चैव नास्मि यौगन्धरायणः !!॥

which is indicative of the sanctimony (the earlier, archaic sense of the word)

attached to even one's own name.

  

Verily, "नामानि दामानि" - as the Veda says !
