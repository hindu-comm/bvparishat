Theoretically speaking, *dharma* is subtle, not arbitrary.

It can be so subtle that it may look arbitrary.

  

As with health, and as with law, causation is not simple here;

multiple parameters invariably enter into the equation.

One of the first things Ayurveda takes note of is multiple causation.

No *dharma-shAstra* text either is insensitive to this procedure and process.  

  

The more the parameters are defined,  

the more defined does *dharma* become.

  

Medicine tends to becomes a hard(er) science in exact proportion to  

the more and the more of the factors becoming quantifiable.

In fixing the quantum of *danDa*,  

Kautalya must have had some such parameters too.

At higher levels, *daNDa* and *dharma* merge.

  

Jurisprudence must indeed be handled only by those of very high sensibilities.

High sensibility also demands high sensitivity  

\- to causes and consequences.

  

As with ready-made clothes, certain *dharma*-s are fairly uniform for all;

for situations otherwise, we require tailor-made solutions.

Hence the division into *sAmAnya-dharma*-a*, visheSha-dharma*-s and *Apad-dharma*-s.
