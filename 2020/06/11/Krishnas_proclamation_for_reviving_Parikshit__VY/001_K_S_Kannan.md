As to some of the 'equally good alternatives' suggested by Sri Aditya-ji:

they can be easily answered by *ashoka-vanikA-nyAya.*

  

Why did Ravana put Sita under an *ashoka* tree?

Well, he could have put her under any other tree - say the *rasAla*;  

but then, a person like Mr. A is apt to ask :

why under *rasAla*? why not under *ashoka*?

  

There is a bad joke which is pretty famous (= not mine):

  

Q: What was God doing before creation?

A: He was busy creating hell for people who ask questions like you!

  

I don't remember the source of this, but it tells a harsh truth

(which it could have said in a soft manner).

One could also ask why did Mr.X put this question today at 8.07 pm?

  

Many questions can have no answers,

unless it can be established that  

the question at hand has indeed a lot of intrinsic significance,

or that there is one certain specific answer only,

a *sine qua non* of sorts, or one of profound significance.

  

The algebra teacher began solving the problem.

"Let the unknown be *x*", he said.

A student stood up and asked him challengingly :

"Why not *y*, sir?"

  

Questions can sometimes be asked *ad infinitum* or *ad nauseum.*

(And I am not saying every/any particular question here is being asked like this.)  

  

But where will this take us?

Doesn't the meta-why (= the why of why)  

sometimes become important?
