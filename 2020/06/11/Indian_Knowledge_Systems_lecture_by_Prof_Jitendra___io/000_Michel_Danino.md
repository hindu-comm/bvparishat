Dear All,

After a hiatus, we resume lectures in our current IKS course, **The ancient “Idea of India”** at IIT Gandhinagar. We expect three more speakers, the first of whom is **Dr. Jitendra Shah** on Thursday 11 June at 3:30 PM.

Dr. Jitendra Shah, a reputed scholar of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit, has had a long association with the L.D. Institute of Indology, Ahmedabad, among others; he also collaborated with the Government of India's National Mission for Manuscripts. Dr. Jitendra Shah will speak on "**Manuscript Traditions of India and Transmission of knowledge**", an important integrating component in classical India's intellectual life.

A fuller profile and abstract can be seen [here](http://iks.iitgn.ac.in/jitendra-shah-2020/) on the IKS course's website.

The lecture will be [livestreamed on IITGn's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/IITGN1/live).

All are welcome! Please feel free to forward to anyone who may be interested.

Best regards,

Michel
