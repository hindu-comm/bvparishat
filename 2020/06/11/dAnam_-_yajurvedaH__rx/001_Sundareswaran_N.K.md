**So , if the दानम् is offered to a ब्राह्मण (श्रोत्रिय - श्रोत्रियंश्छन्दो’धीते पा सू ) he can get rid of the same through स्वाध्याय । Others cannot do it .**

  

A brāhmaņa cannot get rid of dāna by Svādhyāya.

It is the *pāpmā* of *dakşiņā-*s which got eradicated by Brahmins.

  

The cited passage of the *Taittirīya Āraņyaka* actually extols the efficacy of Svādhyāya in expelling sins.

  

  

*Agni* is said to be afflicted by sin right at his birth. Gods expelled his sin by *āhuti*-s. The sin of *āhuti*-s,in turn, was expelled by *yajňa-*s. The sin of *yajňa-*s was removed by *dakşiņā*-s. And the sin of *dakşiņā*-s got expelled by *brāhmaņa-*s. Their sin was eradicated by *chandāmsi* (Veda-s). And Veda-s were purified by *Svādhyāya*.

Thus goes the explanation.

  

'Pāpmā' is the word employed in the passage, which has been translated as 'sin'.

  

( अग्निं वै जातं पाप्मा जग्राह तं देवा आहुतीभिः पाप्मानमपाघ्नन्नाहुतीनां यज्ञेन यज्ञस्य दक्षिणाभिर्दक्षिणानां ब्राह्ममणेन ब्राह्मणस्य छन्दोभिश्छन्दसाँ स्वाध्यायेन ...... )

  

Those who are interested may refer to my paper , ***The concept of Pañcamahāyajña-s: Origin and transformation*** (available in [academia.edu](http://academia.edu)), for more details.
