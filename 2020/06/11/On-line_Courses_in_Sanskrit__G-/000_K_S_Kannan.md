Dear All,

  

A friend of mine has sought this information.

Can somebody help?

  

There are various organisations all over the country giving on-line courses in Sanskrit. Of these,  

\(a\) some require students to attend their on-line classes, while  

\(b\) some are okay with students taking the exam straightaway.

  

Now, is there a website or book-reference where  

the list and details of the above are spelt out?

Have their mutual equivalences been worked out either?

Regards
