Just to add to the information:  
  
In Rajasthan, the argalA (अर्गला) changes to AgaLa (आगळ) and refers to the small door lock that has a ring outside. Using this, the door can be closedshut, and opened from outside by turning the ring, no one needs to come to the door to open it.

So, it keeps the door closed, and locked so no cow can push the doors and open them, yet, members coming from outside can simply open it without anyone to get up.

  

To this, there is also a chain with a large nail (कील) that is used to 'lock' from inside, so that now, no one can open from outside by turning the ring.

  

And of course, if you really really wanted to lock it, then you put a real LOCK through instead of the keela.  

  

The word large nail and small nail are keela (कीळ), and killee(किल्लि)

Note the La for the original large strong version, and the use of lli for the smaller version!

This is what you would see from inside.

This is from outside.

One ring is just a knocker, the other turns as well to rotate the latch that is inside.

This is the *kind of*keela that would be put from inside, if you wanted to disable opening from outside.
