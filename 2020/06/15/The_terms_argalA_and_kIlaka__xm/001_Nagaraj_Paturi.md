I just saw your question on Indology list on this topic.

  

Thought you must be so desperate to know the answer that you could not wait for the upaasakasand tantrajnas here to respond.

  

Let me begin so that senior upaasakasand tadjnaswill join.

  

अर्गलाandकीलकम्‌ are just opposite to each other in meaning.

  

 अर्गला is a lock and कीलकम्‌ is a key.  

  

 अर्गला is a cross bar used for stopping the unwanted and dangerous from entering.

  

 कीलकम्‌ is a key used to open the lock.

  

In mantra / tantraअर्गलाis in reference to protective mantra.  

  

 कीलकम्‌ is in reference to a countering mantra.

  

There is an अर्गला स्तोत्रम्‌ and कीलक स्तोत्रम्‌ too.  

  

But these two words are used in reference to certain portions of a mantra based tantra practice too. They are part of other similar concepts such as बीजम्‌, हृदयम्‌ etc.
