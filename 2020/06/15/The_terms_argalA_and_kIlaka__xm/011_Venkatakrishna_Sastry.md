Namaste



The theme of Sanskrit-computers has been explored over four decades now all around the world, with great passion. I grew up listening to this statement and inspired by it.

The current covid- scenario pushing on line education of indian languages in early schooling, the challenge of on-line sanskrit teaching added to the urge. 



I have made a humble effort to take a relook at Dr. Briggs statement (of 1984) in 2020 and pen this book. You can get a ' look inside' the book at amzon page.



This book is not about 'code' and 'font'. The focus is on where and how
are we heading with 'Sanskrit placed in computers' ?



Authos Driving questions ( which may be considered as rash and trash )
in pushing out this book : 

Why Sanskrit is not finding its rightful place in Digital technology ? What is hold up? - People, Mind set, Technology, Funding, Complacent attitude, Easy going ??

How Panini studies are undergoing
digestion and dilution based on Romanizaed representation of script and anglicization of technolgy?

 Is unicode standards, font and computational linguistics the final frontier for Sanskrit -computer exploration ?

 How would 'Sanskrit- Language technology' help rest of Indian languages under ' brahmi - Indian Languages' ? ( the artificail divide of aryan-dravidian apart !)

 Can Sanskrit-Computers technology walk on its own feet and deliver Brahmi Langauge solutions?

Why and How this initiaitve would be critical for a nation where english is not the first langauge, mother tongue, cultural legacy ?

 Can this initiaitve create skilled jobs, augment economy like yoga ( even in its diluted form) a three trillion dollar USD market across 177 plus nations ?

Whose initiative this needs to be :
Linguist, Technologist, Corporate, University, Governemnt, Religious Institutions , Community at large ? 



The book is first teaching resource for (on line and on campus; workshop/ courses ) on 'Brahmi Language Teachnology' as Non-roman script initiative and Voice Primary Paninian approach for A.I .
devices.

The audience : Panini specialists, Sanskrit-Computer enthusiasts, Indian Langauge software developers, Engineering students, Translators, Sanskrit resoruce data builders.



Please write to me off line if you desire to have a draft copy for review ( you are welcome to add your review on Amazon web page) , organize workshop, lectures.
