Dear Nagaraj Ji,

  

  I am not desperate, but I tend to ask all those who may possibly know the answers to my questions. In that respect, members of Indology and BVP are all of equal value to me. In any case, thanks for your explanation. I have been looking for a Sanskrit commentary that would explain these terms, but so far I have not found one. I have heard the term कीलक in the Ramaraksha Stotra that I had memorized during my childhood, but never thought about this term, and the term अर्गला till someone asked me this question.
