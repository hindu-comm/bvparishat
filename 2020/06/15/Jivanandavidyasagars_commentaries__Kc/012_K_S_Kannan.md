Probably, if the first announcement itself was such that  

the texts are yet to be finalised, and hence help in proof-reading  

was welcome/solicited, the level of expectation raised would have been different.

  

There are many websites that keep announcing that help is needed for proof-reading,

and there would be some who do things voluntarily, though there may be some  

who expect some compensation but do a good job.

  

The very purpose of the search facility can be lost

if the text is not accurate; won't it even be misleading?

You may get some sample testing done, therefore, and announce that

the accuracy of the text is, say, 90%. Help may be forthcoming

rather than "criticism".  

  

It also becomes the duty of a scholar

to indicate the presence of errors once they are spotted.

Unless they are spiteful, even that indication can be taken as a cautionary help,

so that the next steps can be thought over.

  

It is not just a question of giving criticism positively or negatively,

it is also a question of taking comments positively or negatively.

Otherwise you feel hurt that for all the trouble you have taken,

it was given to ungrateful colleagues. If you start with saying

can somebody help with fixing the errors, the expectation built is different.

Else, colleagues may think you may not even know the presence of errors.
