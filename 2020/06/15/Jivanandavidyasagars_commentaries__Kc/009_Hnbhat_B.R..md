In vicky sansckrit open source, it is open for the readers to correct whether sighning in to their account or without sighning in and all the correction will be saved. This kind of arrangement can be made in this site also so that any reader finding errors could correct themselves in the text.

  

I had made corrections in many texts as I was made use of them in the viky sanskrit sorce texts.

  

Then making readers community responsibility will be meaninggful. Without any such arrangement, it is meaningless.
