Dear Krishna Prasad Ji,

  

  Your Adishila fonts are exquisitelybeautiful, but I have to agree with the assessment of the texts as they are provided. They need to be seriously edited before circulating them. I found numerous errors per page on many of these texts. I hope someone will proof-read them. Till then, you should withhold their circulation.
