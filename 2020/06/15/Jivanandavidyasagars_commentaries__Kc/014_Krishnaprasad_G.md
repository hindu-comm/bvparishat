Over a period of time I will updated the corrected files. Until then the google search gives the results from the website.which serves my purpose. I have only 80 books in my mind which I am going to upload. After that I will start correcting them. That doesn't mean all the files uploaded now are full of errors.. Vishnusahasranama, Sankhya karika, and Kosha received by Dr Dhaval Patel etc are quite good.  
I don't trust in Wikisource. If the authority is given for correction some may wrongly edit the text or Some may even split the sandhi. Splitting sandhi is serious problem. I am trying to do the best for Sanskrit.  
Git hub is good with that but still I have some technical problems with that.  
Thanks
