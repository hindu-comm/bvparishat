Respected krishnakashyapji, sorry for delayed reply.

The meaning of this shlok

यदि शैलसमं पापं विस्तीर्णं बहुयोजनम्।

भिद्यते ध्यानयोगेन नान्यो भेदः कदाचन।।

  

is as follows.

Even If heap of sins is as big as mountain, it is destroyed (bhidyate i.e pierced) only by meditation. There is no other means to destroy it.

Rajkumari trikha
