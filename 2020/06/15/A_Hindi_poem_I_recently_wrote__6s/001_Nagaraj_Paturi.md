“But one creature said at last, "I am tired of**clinging**. Though I cannot see it with my eyes, I trust that

the current knows where it is going. I shall let go, and let it take me where it will.**Clinging**, I shall die of boredom.”  

  

                                   
                                   
                  - "Illusions" by Richard Bach
