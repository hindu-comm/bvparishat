That is the spoken language I hear from the in-laws of my daughter.
That is a Hindu family from Ajmer and Agra. The spoken Hindi is not exactly the hyper-Sanskritized Hindi that is now taught in text-books.
Certainly, the Hindi spoken in Hindi movies is close to Hindustani, rather than the hyper-Sanskritized text-book Hindi. The famous poem Madhushala written by Harivansh Rai Bachchan has this Hindustani Hindi.
