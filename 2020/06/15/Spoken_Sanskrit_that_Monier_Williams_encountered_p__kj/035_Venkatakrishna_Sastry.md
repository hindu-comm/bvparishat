Namaste



I had my interactions with Prof. Cardona at Kerala in one of those conferences where he presented a series of sessions on Mahabhashya.



Post lunch and evening sessions, conversing in samskruth, showed his commitment to ' Muni-traya' and 'Shishta' approach to Samskruth studies.

That is very uncommon amongst western, and many oriental scholars also !

His thesis work ( published) displays his position.



I learnt an important lesson in this conversation: Historical details and profiling of grammarians is different from commitment to Langauge standards provided by the grammarians tradition. Histoical views of grammarians have never sought ' over riding the standards set by Panini-Patanjali-Yaska' combine in learning- using Samskrutham.



On a question about ' Bodon Chair model and drive', about the deviation from Muni-traya paddhati voluntarily embraced in modern Sanskrit studies, Prof. Cardona said: ' I stand by Muni-traya Shishta sampradaya'. 'No comments on what others do'. 

Prof. Saroja Bhate ji was also amongst the discussions and she endorsed Prof. Cardonas posiiton.



Good memmories recalled.
