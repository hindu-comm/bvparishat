Prof. Kannan,

  

There are two models of the theses of 'Death of Sanskrit"

  

1\. Sanskrit lost its continuity of being spoken.

  

2\. Creativity stopped getting expressed through Sanskrit after 1800

  

Prof. Pollock's is the second.

  

Quote from Monier Williams belongs to the first category.

  

Regarding the second, we have been producing umteen evidences of novel creative things that happened around 1800 and later to disprove that thesis. Dr J Hannender published a detailed article in disagreement of Prof. Polock's thesis though not exactly the way we have been arguing. He calls the category #1 above as public view about Death of Sanskrit.

I once quoted post on Indology from Prof. Deshpande expressing his disagreement with Prof. pollock's thesis:

What is interesting is

  

Indologists know Swami Sacchidanandendra Saraswati and how he made history through his Sanskrit writings in the lineage /genealogyof the Advaita thought.They don't show it as a counter to the loss of
Sanskrit's creativity.

  

They know Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayananda Saraswati's Sanskrit writings and how he made history through Sanskrit or Sanskrit made history through him. But that is not mentioned as a counter.

  

They know how Sanskrit created history through the writings of Kavyakantha Vasishtha Ganapati Muni.

  

They know Prof. Reva Prasad Dwivedi. Recently in my conversation with him, Prof. Dwivedi expressed his sahridayataapuurvaka admiration for Prof. Pollock. But his works do not come to their mind when they talk of lack of modern expression or contemporaneity in Sanskrit.

  

We do not know whether they know of classical Carnatic lyrics in Sanskrit. Birth of new genres, popular performing art genres like Harikathaa in Sanskrit.

  

The list goes on and on and on.

  

I am bringing out a whole book with as many of these as possible. leave alone explaining, just enlisting may make a book.

  

This is required for those Indians themselves who may get carried away by these seemingly valid theorizations.

  

I wanted to say that the quote under discussion belongs to category #1 above not to #2.
