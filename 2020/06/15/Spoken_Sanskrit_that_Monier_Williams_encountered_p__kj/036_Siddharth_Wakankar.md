Dr. Kannan,

  

I purposely did not mention about his own assessment of his book on Gujarati but,he now almost disowns it for obviousreasons and told me to forget that .

  

I know the inner story also but dont want to divulge it on this platform.

  

Any way,no doubt about his upasthiti in Panini etc.and his scholarship .It is a pleasure to be in his company. I feel proud that whenever he comes in India, he makes a point to meet me and my family members.

A gem of a thorough gentleman scholar,which is rarity now a days and most lovable friend.

  

Fond memories.

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
