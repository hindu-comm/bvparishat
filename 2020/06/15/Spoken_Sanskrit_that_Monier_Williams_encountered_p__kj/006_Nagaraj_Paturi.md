Prof. Deshpande,

  

The following are the differences:

  

1\. Monier Williams says in the passage :

  

We English scholars treat Sanskṛit as a dead language, but here in India I am expected to speak it as if it were my mother-tongue.

  

I think you are other Indians of those times probably did not treat English as a dead language.

  

2\. You encountered the spoken English of dock workers. Monier Williams encountered spoken Sanskrit of the Sanskrit Pandits.

  

If Monier Williams learnt Tamil and reached Madras harbour and encountered the spoken Tamil of the dock workers or he learnt Marathi, reached Bombay harbour and encountered the spoken Marathi of dock workers, the experiences would have been similar.

  

We are talking of a view towards Sanskrit that it is a dead language. English like Tamil, Marathi etc. is not being discussed as a dead language anywhere.

  

Focus is here is not the culture shock of a person who realizes that his /her knowledge of his second language that he/she learnt as a foreign language that is viewed undisputedly as a living language is not sufficient to communicate in the place where it is spoken as a mother tongue. Focus here is on Sanskrit and the validity of that being considered as a dead language.
