I was interacting with him, as he was doing fieldwork in the Telugu speaking areas that I was also doing fieldwork in.

  

In a conference, one Indian Telugu scholar, pro-Indic in general, for some reason was saying that widows are ill treated in Hiduism because of Dharma Shastras. Prof. Knipe, who was, as a paper presenter, sitting there, quickly and loudly said, " no! I can show you how shaastrasordain that a widow who lives in love for her lost husband is auspicious and worthy of worship and was pulling out a book from his book to read out a few verses from a book. Though I don't remember the details in full, which book, which verse etc., (as I was engrossed in preparing for the presentation of my own paper), I was pleasantly amazed at his shraddhaa that I couldn't find in my own Indian colleagues.
