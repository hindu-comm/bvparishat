As my PhD advisor, I had the fortune to work with Professor Cardona at the University of Pennsylvania during theyears 1968-72. Professor Cardona is an exception to the norm of western scholarship. He was first trained at Yale University by stalwarts like Professor Paul Thieme. Then he spent a significant amount of time studying in the medium of Sanskrit with Pade Shastri at Baroda and later with Pandit Raghunath Sharma. I remember him telling me the story of his going from Varanasi to the village where Pt. Sharma lived. He was asked by Pt. Sharma that he comes very early every morning, takes a bath before he comes, and refrains from eating non-vegetarian food. Cardona agreed to all these conditions and studied with Pt. Sharma. Through his studies with Pade Shastri and Pt. Raghunath Sharma, Cardona acquired deep familiarity with the Shastric traditions. But at the same time, he remained a leading Indo-Europeanist. He is a true Ubhaya-Vidyā-Vidvān, a rare personality indeed. As the circumstances would happen, during my student days at Penn, Cardona was on leave for a year, and during that year, his teacher Professor Paul Thieme came to Penn as a visiting professor, and I had the opportunity to study with him as well, and to observe the similarity between Thieme and Cardona in some respects.
