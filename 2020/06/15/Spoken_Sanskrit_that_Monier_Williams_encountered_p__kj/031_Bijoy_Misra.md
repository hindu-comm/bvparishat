I met Prof Cardona in 2000 here in Harvard in a Conference. He appeared to me as a scholar who "knew everything."

We did communicate on email many times and he was of immense help in my own exploration of Indian texts.

A total pedestrian, he knew his every step well.. He was preparing his transition to the new housing when I last

communicated with him. His access and humility were most impressive!
