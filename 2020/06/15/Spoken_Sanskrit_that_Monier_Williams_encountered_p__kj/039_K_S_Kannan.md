Yes, Prof. Paturi. Very well stated, and very truly said.

It is only such among the non-Indian scholars (and for that matter, even Indian ones)

who are essentially subversive and supercilious that we need to be wary about.

  

But then, if the number of such scholars keeps swelling,

as it has been happening in recent times too and to a large extent,

a general distrust will be inspired, and a general repugnance, about the entire tribe

\- a predicament of their own making. That they do not care about it is yet another matter.  

  

Nor can it be argued that their cabals and clouts have ceased to exist or be active.

Westerners, by and large, are well organised :

When they want to ruin a civilisation, they go about it very systematically.

They have honed their skills in developing sophisticated lobbies and organised crime,

and as they say, "Whenever a politician wants to commit a crime,

he will first declare it as his duty".

  

Even TSEliot was weary about the vaunted and much flaunted Western "interventionism".

  

No other heritage has been at the receiving ends from the Western academic/intellectual bullies

as has the Indian heritage. The typical Hindu mildness and noninterventionistic attitude  

is construed but as weakness and as a mark of effeminacy. To be masculine is, *to them*,  

to hit back - below the belt, especially, for such has been their own creed from times immemorial.

  

The typical Hindu seldom suspects their motives.

But "Wendy's Children" as they are called, have been showing clearly what they are up to,

and what level they can stoop to. And some/many Indians are, tragically, only too ready

to subserve their interests as sepoys and mercenaries - of which

Devadutt Patnaik is an easy and outstanding example.  

  

Hindus are getting to be aware of the unwarranted shabby treatment they are getting,  

and it will not be too long, even if not quite easy, that Hindus will begin to reclaim their heritage,

now under the control, totally, more or less, of the West at its worst.
