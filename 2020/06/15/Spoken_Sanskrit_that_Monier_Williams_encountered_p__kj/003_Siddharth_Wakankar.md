I am reminded of a wonderful Presidential Address in Chaste but simple Sanskrit delivered by my friend,Prof Dr. George Cardona,at the Varanasi Session of the AIOC in December ,2004.

  

He himself being an outstanding grammarian, he committed no grammatical mistake in his long lecture. It was a treat to listen to him,that too,in Varanasi in the presence of Sanskrit Pandits of high order. They also were wonderstruck at this feat.

  

Kudos to such dedicated foreign Sanskrit scholars.
