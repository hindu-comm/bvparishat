Professor Jayakrushna Mishra was in the Sanskrit Faculty when we were in college in the '60s.

He passed away in 1979. In 2001, Odisha Sahitya Academy released his epic in Sanskrit,

मातृमुक्तिमुक्तावली, a gorgeous 724 page चम्पूकाव्य narrating the India's freedom struggle in

which he was a participant. It may still be in print.
