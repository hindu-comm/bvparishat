Dear Professor Kannan,

  

  I don't recollect this particular detail about his life in Varanasi. What I remember him telling me is the life he had while he was studying with Pt. Raghunath Sharma and living in the village where Pt. Sharma used to live. I now don't recollect the name of this village,but it was some distance from Varanasi. While studying with Pt. Sharma, he had to take a bath before going to Pt. Sharma's house early in the morning, and to remain vegetarian during that time. My own memory of some of these conversations with Professor Cardona is now almost 50 years old. Nowadays, he and his wife live in a continuing care community in New Jersey. I have been talking to him frequently these days to find out more about the community that he lives in, as my wife and I are thinking of our own remaining years. Some of our friends here in California are thinking about creating one of these continuing care communities for our own needs.
