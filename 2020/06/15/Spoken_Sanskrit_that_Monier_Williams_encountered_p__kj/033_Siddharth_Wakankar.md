Hope,many of his close friends must be knowing that he has written a book in English on Gujarati Language and I think it was published by his university.

  

Besides learning Sanskrit at the Oriental Institute,Baroda,( where I worked for more than 32 years-1977 to 2009) at the feet of Pandit J.D.Padeshastri, he learnt Gujarati from Dr.S.D.Parekh,a Research Officer in Gujarati and wrote that book. He still speaks in Gujarati.

  

Sometimes,he used to stay with me and would proudly repeat that he is strictly a vegetarian when he comes to Baroda or India. I found him to be a very sound scholar of Sanskrit Grammar besides being a gentleman to the core and eager to help anyone academically.

  

My entire family has very fond memories of his association and cordial relationship.  

  

Prof. Siddharth Y Wakankar.
