I lived, studied and worked in the US for two decades.

Being truly international in nature, especially the universities, one gets to meet people from all over, with all sorts of accents when speaking English.

  

Everyone is enamoured by the broken/heavily accented English of an Italian, French, Swede or Swiss. And these can be students as well, not scholars/professors.

But an Indian accent is laughable!

No one ridicules a French for messing up English.  

And let me not even mention Chinese accent! :)

  

  

This part is all about the prejudiced notion one has of a culture.

The TV serials never showed any Indian who has accomplished anything. They are either store keepers, taxi drivers or nerds, nothing in between.

  

Here I am talking about those who came to the US for the first time to study, not those who were born there.

  
  

Thanks,
