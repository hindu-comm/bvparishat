Very glad to see the positive vibes that the mention of Prof. George Cardona's name is evoking.

  

There are many older threads on this list itself where he was discussed with great respect and affection.

  

This is a proof of how Bharatiya scholars receive a Sanskrit scholar positively with respect and affection irrespective of his nationality.

  

There are a good number of such Sanskrit scholars from outside India that are loved and respected by Bharatiya Sanskrit scholars.

  

For that matter, till recently, all Sanskrit scholars from outside Bharat were loved and respected by Bharatiya Sanskrit scholars and Bharatiya general public . Bharatiyas always thought that any non-Indian studying Sanskrit, Bharat, Bharatiya culture, languages and literatures in them does so out of love and respect for Bharat and Bharatiya.

  

It is only recently that a section of Bharatiya Sanskrit scholars and Bharatiya general public have been receiving the work of Sanskrit scholars from outside Bharat critically, not as blindly as earlier and have been expressing shock at the hate these scholars have for their subject matter i.e., Sanskrit, Bharat, Bharatiya culture, languages and literatures in them etc. Still, a big section of Bharatiya Sanskrit scholars and Bharatiya general public continue to love and respect Sanskrit scholars from outside Bharat not mindful of their political views, affiliations and activities.

  

At a time when the expressions of the critically receiving section of Bharatiya Sanskrit scholars and Bharatiya general public  towards the shenanigans of both Bharatiya and non-Bharatiya Sanskrit scholars are getting highlighted giving an impression that all non-Bharatiya scholars are being criticized, the present discussion on Prof. Cardona shows that the criticism is not based on the criterion of Bharatiya and non-Bharatiya but it is based on the hate or no hate for Sanskrit, Bharat, Bharatiya culture, languages and literatures in them.

  

I have my own sweet memories of interaction with Prof. Cardona as I had to discuss my MPhil topic " Vakyapadiyamas the book providing the Linguistic Theory behind Ashtadhyayi".
