Prof Cardona shared this with me. Apparently he had prepared his address in English but found that everyone before him spoke in Sanskrit. So he delivered his address in Sanskrit itself.

  

He also added the following post script: after the morning session was over, scholars were in the hall networking with each other, waiting for lunch to be called. Prof Cardona found himself in conversation with a woman scholar, a distinguished grammarian herself. They were conversing in Hindi, a language Prof Cardona is familiar with in several variants incl Bhojpuri. At one point, this lady asked him , "they were saying a western scholar was to make an address, whatever happened to that, I wonder.". Prof Cardona had to confess it was indeed he who was that western scholar. I may add that Prof Cardona is of slight build and could be easily mistaken for a somewhat fair looking Indian. No doubt the confusion would have been aided by the fact that Prof Cardona has no foreign accent at all in his Sanskrit.  

  

Hope this helps,
