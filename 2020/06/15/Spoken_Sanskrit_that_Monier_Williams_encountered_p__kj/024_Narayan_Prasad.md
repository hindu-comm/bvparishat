\<\< Prof Cardona ... had prepared his address in English but found that everyone before him spoke in Sanskrit.

   So he delivered his address in Sanskrit itself.

   ......... ........  

   Prof Cardona found himself in conversation with a woman scholar, a distinguished grammarian herself.  

  They were conversing in Hindi, a language Prof Cardona is familiar with in several variants incl. Bhojpuri.

   ......... ........  

  Prof Cardona has no foreign accent at all in his Sanskrit. \>\>  

  

  Thank you so muchfor this information!

  

  Regards

  Narayan Prasad
