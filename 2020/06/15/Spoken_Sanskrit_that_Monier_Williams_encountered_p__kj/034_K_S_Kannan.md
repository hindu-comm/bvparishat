I remember to have read somewhere that he himself had "confessed"

that he was not quite proud of his book on Gujarati grammar

as it was his first work, written somewhat prematurely or so.

  

My wordings may not be exact, but it was to some such effect he had written.

And even this indeed reflects positively upon him :  

to be able to speak a bit negatively where warranted about even his own work

\- thus showing objectivity as also the strictness of a grammarian

(or rather, the strictness of a Sanskrit grammarian).
