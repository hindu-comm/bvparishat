Dr R Ganesh:

  

As bhuurja-patra-s were used in the northern India, it is is obvious that inks of various colours -- preferably of the darker shades, such as red or black-- were employed. Unlike the taala-patra-s, the most common writing material of South India, barks of bhuurja cannot bear the hard stylus, known as kanTa in Kannada and Telugu. KanTa-s were used to engrave the palm leaves while tuulikaa-s were meant for painting/writing on the bhuurja(britch)-barks. Even the great poet kaalidaasa refers to writing on the bhuurja-patra-s with red coloured ink.
