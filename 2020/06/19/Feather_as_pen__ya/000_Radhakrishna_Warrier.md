We see in some modern illustrations ancient ṛṣis holding the feather for writing. Factually, was feather ever used in ancient India for writing?
In my understanding, writing was done in ancient times on palm leaf using the stylus.  



In Malayalam, there is a word tūlika meaning feather used for writing.
It is used as a figurative word for pen also – as in the tūlika is more powerful than the sword. I don’t know whether it is a Sanskrit/Prakrit origin word or a pure Dravidian word. Another word for feather (not in the sense of pen, but in the sense of the feather of a bird) is tūval.
