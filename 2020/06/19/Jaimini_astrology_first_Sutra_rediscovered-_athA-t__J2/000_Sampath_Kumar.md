I want to explore one tremendous fact about Jaimini's sutra, Generally every sutra in sanskrit start with Atha \[అథ-अथ\] No sanskrit Sutra text started without atha अथ in first Sutra. Now , if we see the first Sutra in Jaimini Sanskrit Sutra text first Sutra is उपदॆशं व्याख्यास्यामः 1-1-1, So it is incomplete Sutra.-

 Complete Sutra is found in one rare sanskrit Manuscript- That Sutra is-  अथाऽतॊ जन्म जिज्ञासा 1-1-1

Second Sutra is -   परीक्षिकस्य धीर्धुरंधर्यमुपदॆशं व्याख्यास्यामः 1-1-2

I made KaTaPaYa - for 3 words ,अथातः -जन्म-जिज्ञासा ; then 671-58-708 numbers are came, = these are divided by 12 signs, Then 11-10-12 houses came ,those are Artha-Kama-Moksha in one aspect,The Jaimini system will be able to know the secrets of these 3 purusharthas in one' life......again i have to calculate with planets =9 and etc..... wait for that research, you are also welcome to do more about this- Good luck
