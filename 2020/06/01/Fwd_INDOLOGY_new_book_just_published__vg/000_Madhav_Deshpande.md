Dear Colleagues,  
  
I would like to draw your attention to this newly published book:  
  
*Oral-Written-Performed: the Rāmāyana narratives in Indian literature and arts,* ed. by Danuta Stasik (Heidelberg: CrossAsia eBooks, 2020).
The whole book as well as the individual chapters can be accessed under the DOI: [https://doi.org/10.11588/xabooks.530](https://doi.org/10.11588/xabooks.530) (for free download, or print editions for purchase). It is the outcome of a panel at the 25th European Conference on South Asian Studies, Paris, July 2018).  

  

I should declare an interest in that both Mary and I have chapters in it ("Showing what is not: the use of illusion in classical Sanskrit Rāma plays" and "Stories in stone: sculptural representations of the Rāmāyaṇa narrative" respectively).  
  
With all good wishes  
  
John Brockington
