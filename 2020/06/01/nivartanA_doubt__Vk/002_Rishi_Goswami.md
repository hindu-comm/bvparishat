Facing alot of difficulty.

Will need someone's help.

What is Vakyartha of  
न भक्षयेत्?  
like यजेत means  
यागेन इष्टंं भावयेत्। what does न भक्षयेत् mean।

also can we use Vaiyakarana definition of वारणार्थानाम् ईप्सितः?  
वारणं प्रवृत्तिविमुखीकरणम् तज्जनकव्यापरो निवर्तना। then we don't need to imagine प्रागभाव etc

If any Mimamsaka has number please give. My email
